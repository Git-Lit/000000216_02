Time wore on, the winter passed over, and
early in the spring Monsieur de Verancour
had been brought to regard as admissible
the event which had at first appeared in
his sight so enormously ridiculous;—the
possible marriage of his eldest daughter
with Eichard Prevost.


It must not, however, be supposed that
this was easily accomplished. Felicie did  
  
  
  VOL. II. B
<!-- Leaf 16, Page: 2 -->
not find it sufficient to gain one or two
isolated battles; she had a complete
campaign to undertake, and her final victory
was due only to her patience and
consummate good generalship. She never lost
her temper and never lost a point; but let
what would be the insignificance of her gain
of the previous day, she always contrived
to add some small gain to it on the
following one, so that, in the coinse of a month
or two, by dint of clever treatment, the
Vicomte got quite accustomed to his new
position, and, in the prospects of her future
wealth, consented to lose sight of the fact
that his daughter would become the wife
of a valet de chambre's grandson. One
thing was settled at the very outset, and
that was, that the matter should be kept
secret; that no word of the future
<!-- Leaf 17, Page: 3 -->
engagement should transpne; and that not until
Monsieur Eichard had left D, and taken
rank in the department as Monsieur de
ChateaubreviUe, should he be presumed to
have aspired to the honour of Mademoiselle
de Verancour's hand.


What principally disposed the Vicomte
in favour of the coming mesalliance was,
that, besides the wealth of the bridegroom,
the whole proceeding had about it a
character of barter that was serious and
satisfactory. There was nothing sentimental
in the whole concern. All was
businesslike and fuU of calculation. Had the
unfortunate Monsieur Eichard put himseU in
the Ught of an aspmng lover, of a man
who, for the sake of becoming Felicie's
husband, would sacrifice every other earthly
consideration in life, it is probable that
<!-- Leaf 18, Page: 4 -->
the young lady herself would have crushed
his hopes with withering contempt, and it
is certain that on such terms the Vicomte
would never have consented to accept
Monsieur Eichard as his son-in-law. B*ut the
latter was wise enough to understand this,
and he never once alluded to the
possibility of his marriage being anything more
than a business transaction. This put all
parties at their ease, and made the
situation clear and comprehensible. Monsieur
Eichard, having a very large fortune, which,
situated as he was, could be of no use to
him, found means, through the
condescension of the Verancour family, of securing
to himseU a status in society, and of being
admitted to spend his money among people
of rank and bUth. This, of course, could
not be purchased at too high a rate, and,
<!-- Leaf 19, Page: 5 -->
in fact, Monsieur Eichard got it a vast deal
too cheap. On the other hand,
Mademoiselle Felicie, instead of being condemned
to lead a Use of single blessedness in an
out-of-the-way province, with not enough to
live upon decently, acquired the free disposal
of an income much exceeding that of the
most fashionable ladies for several miles
round. This was as it should be, and there
was a sense of fitness in the fact of a
Verancour enjoying a hundred thousand francs a
year.


The work of renovation and
embellishment at Chateaubreville went on apace,
and would have been Ur an advanced stage
of completion, had it not been for poor
Monsieur Eichard's health. The winter
had been extremely severe, and the unlucky
young man had been a frequent sufferer.
<!-- Leaf 20, Page: 6 -->
His lungs were said to be delicate, though
the fact was made a matter of dispute
between two rival practitioners; the old
doctor at D declaring for the
weakness of the chest, and a young doctor,
lately settled at Cholet, taking the part of
"nerves," and at most only tolerating the
notion of bronchial susceptibility. But
then this new disciple of Æsculapius was
a man who made light of everything,
according to the way of the modern Parisian
school. It was a wonder he believed in
death,—some said he called it an accident,
—and he did not promise to have any
success Ui his provincial sphere. He treated
poor Monsieur Eichard somewhat severely,
never called him " poor" at all, and
shrugged his shoulders at those who did.
He openly declared that the ailments of
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 7 -->
Monsieur Eichard were only laziness and
seU-nidulgence, and told him to his face
that he would never be weU tiU he took
more exercise, lived more in the aU, washed
more in cold water, and eat fewer
sweetmeats. He affirmed that whatever harm
there was, came from the liver and the
mucous membrane, and that the patient's
absurd mode of life was answerable for the
whole. But then this young man, Doctor
Javal by name, was of a hard and unkind
nature, and did not sympathise readily with
people who complained overmuch.


It is certain that Monsieur Eichard's
mode of living was unwholesome, but that
struck no one else, for it always has been
a theory in France,—in the provinces above
all,—that the amount of pampering a man
enjoys should be measured only by the
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 8 -->
power of paying for that whereby you
are to be pampered. Therefore, Monsieur
Eichard, being rich, was quite right to
indulge himself in every possible way,—
as he did. The atmosphere he kept up
in his room was that of a forcing-house,
and when he went out of doors he muffled
himself up into a permanent state of
perspiration. He had ordered down a neat little
brougham from Tours, and drove about
with shut windows and a foot-warmer,—
never walking save on the brightest,
warmest days, and for very short
distances. Warm baths he allowed himseU
with the approbation of the old doctor at
D, who was for ever vaunting theU
\"cooling and calming action !" And
sweetmeats he indulged in to a degree
that met with the approbation of no one
<!-- Leaf 23, Page: 9 -->
at all,—not even of Madame Jean, who had
to make them. Altogether the whiter had
severely tried Monsieur Eichard, and his
appearance was unhealthy, as he would
sit shivering over the fire in the salon of
the Chateau, where the inmates never
attained beyond a very moderate degree of
warmth.


With all this, his impatience to be in
the fall enjoyment of his riches seemed
daily to increase in ardour. He was fretful
with desUe to see the house at
ChateaubreviUe fit to be inhabited, and would
sometimes avow to MademoiseUe Felicie
that he counted the days and hours till
he should have entered upon his new
duties as head of one of the principal
estabUshments in the department.
Curiously enough, by degrees, as the state of
<!-- Leaf 24, Page: 10 -->
his health became less satisfactory, fortune
appeared intent upon favouring him more.
An enterprise in which his uncle had
invested a considerable sum, fuU fifteen years
ago,—a copper mine in ChUi, and which had
been supposed to be an unlucky venture,—
suddenly turned up a prize, and Monsieur
Eichard found himself, from day to day,
far richer than he thought. It was evident
now that he would enter upon his
proprietorship of Chateaubreville without having
to deduct from his capital the amount that
the improvements there would have cost.
Well, Monsieur Eichard was a lucky man !
Only it was just at this identical moment
that his health gave symptoms of the
greatest weakness.


\"Compensation!" said the public of
D—; and perhaps it was so. Perhaps
<!-- Leaf 25, Page: 11 -->
it would not have been just U, in addition
to his extraordinary good luck in every
other respect, Monsieur Eichard had had
the robust health and sobd nervous system
of some others who have then livelihood
to earn. It is a just dispensation of
Providence that the possession of great joys and
the power of enjoying them seldom go
together; it consoles those who have only
the capacity for enjoyment without
anything to enjoy, and prevents them from
cutting theU neighbours' throats, or then own.


But what would most have surprised
any EngUsh observer, had he had occasion
to examine minutely the feelings of the
various persons we have introduced to him,
would have been to notice the comparative
absence of what is usuaUy called "feeling"
hi any one of them.
<!-- Leaf 26, Page: 12 -->

Here was a father about to see one of
his daughters take the gravest step that
ever is taken in a woman's Use; here was
a gnl under twenty about to assume upon
herseU the responsibilities of wedlock; and
here was a man about to give all his
worldly advantages for the privilege of
calling this gUl his; — yet in all this,
where was the love;—where tbe sentiment,
compared to which everything else is as
nothing ?


Monsieur de Verancour, amongst all the
objections he saw to Felicie's marriage with
Eichard Prevost, never adverted to the
possible existence of a moral one; never
so much as asked himself whether she
would be happy with this man, or whether
she could be pure and worthy and good:—
whether, at the end of a few years of such
<!-- Leaf 27, Page: 13 -->
a union the immortal part of her would
be better, nobler than now, or weakened
and debased. He simply did not think
of anything of the kind, because no one
that he ever heard of was in the habit of
so doing, and because his duty was merely
to place, to establish his children;—having
done which, he was entitled to hold up
his hand to the Almighty, Uke Simeon, and
chaunt his ISsunc Dimittis in all confidence.
Monsieur de Verancour was, as times go, a
very excellent father; and no one in then
senses would dream of demanding from him
an iota more than what he was doing.  
  
  
  And FeUcie ?


Felicie was, according to the worldly
morals of France, a thoroughly right-minded
person,—a person upon whom you could
count. This means that all the figures
<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 14 -->
you take the trouble to cast up in relation
to her would be found correct; all the
calculations you make would be unerring,
because you never would have to fear one
of those perturbations which are brought
about by the ill-regulated, comet-like
vagaries of a sentiment. Felicie was reliable.
I will not speculate upon what a lover
or even a friend might wish, but depend
upon it there is not in all France a father
or mother who would not be full of pride
and delight if heaven sent them only such
a daughter as Felicie de Verancour.


As to Monsieur Eichard, the future
bridegroom of the fascinating FeUcie, his
nature was too thoroughly feeble a one to
bear the strong tree of love; but be was
possessed by an unceasing desUe to call
the gUl his, and only refrained from
<!-- Leaf 29, Page: 15 -->
manifesting it because his instinct told him that
such a manifestation would be prejudicial to
his interests.


One person alone, in this assemblage of
eminently reasonable individuals, was
unlike the rest, and that person was Vevette.
She was a stray flower in this garden of
pot-herbs, a wild rose upon the wall destined
only to foster fruit. Such being the nature
of her character and life, Vevette was not
regarded by those around her as altogether
safe; and, if she had not been such a
very child, she would have been narrowly
watched, and made to undergo a due and
proper course of training. It was tacitly
understood between the Vicomte and his
eldest daughter that whenever the latter
became Madame de Chateaubreville, and
was the sovereign mistress of her
<!-- Leaf 30, Page: 16 -->
magnificent household, she should take her
younger sister to live with her, and do
the best she could for her advancement in
life. Vevette's "turn," as she had
practically expressed it, would then come, and
neither FeUcie nor her father had the

slightest doubt of bow exemplary it would
be on their parts to contrive that that
\"turn " should be an advantageous one.


The whole of poor little Vevette's life had
been of a kind to mislead her in all ber
appreciations of herseU and of others. She
had lost her mother too young to have seen,
from her example, how perfect a merely
loving woman, aiming at nothing loftier,
could be; and she was far too humble to
imagine that whatever instinctive sentiment
she possessed could be otherwise than
blameable. Of course, her convent
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 17 -->
education had been for her, with her pecuUar
disposition towards timidity and diffidence, the
worst possible education. Convent
discipline, the most enUghtened as weU as the
worst, can seldom or never be good for any
save the haughty and rebeUious in spUit,
whom it does sometimes modify, and to
whom it teaches worldly wisdom as well as
the justice of concession. To the naturally
meek and humble, convent discipline is
simply destruction. It roots up seU-reliance
and preaches dependence as a vfrtue, and
you may pretty surely predict of a convent
favourite that her notions of right and
wrong are not innate, but imposed upon her
from without.


Now, although poor little Vevette's
nature was too sweet and pure a one to
be spoUt by all these mistakes ofeducaVOL. II. c
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 18 -->
tion, her peace of mind was destroyed by
them, and her simplicity of heart perturbed.
Whilst in reality all her own native
instincts were towards the fan and the noble

and the generous, she was driven into being
perpetually at war with herself, and into
believing that whatever she thought, or
wished, or did, must be wrong. On all
sides she had heard her sister lauded as the
pattern of everything a woman should be,
and her own inmost soul, when questioned,
told her she could not be like FeUcie.


It was one of the causes of her love for
Eaoul, that, recognising as he did the
beauty of her nature, he gave ber—
whether she would or not—a kind of trust
ia herself. The great cause of the love,
however, was the impossibility of avoiding
it. They were left to themselves, and they
<!-- Leaf 33, Page: 19 -->
loved, just as it was natural they should do.
But this was precisely one of poor Vevette's
greatest troubles. From the same source
whence she had drawn her piety, her faith
in all divine truths, from that same source
flowed a doctrine which condemned her to
be incessantly at war with herself. That
nature was to be vanquished, and that all
love was a sin;—this was the doctrine of
her teachers. And what was she to do with
such teaching as this ?


Instead of loving frankly and gladly, and
hopefully and strongly, and finding vntue
in the truth of devotion, the poor child
struggled against what was best and noblest
in herseU, and though with her whole heart
she loved Eaoul, the innocence of the
passion was overcast, and she was doomed
to the torture of an unquiet conscience,
<!-- Leaf 34, Page: 20 -->
and to what was worse still, the knowledge
that far from bringing happiness to him sbe
best loved, she, by her own uncertainties
and alarms, brought him perpetual
perplexity and pain.


But in this little out-of-the-way town of
D, events were in store which
threatened to force the persons, we have been
attempting to describe, out of then
conventional parts into the real characters which
had been alloted to them in the grave and
serious drama of Use.
<!-- Leaf 35 -->
  
  CHAPTEE XV.  
  
  
  THE BRIDE.

As the domain of Chateaubreville lay at the
other side of the department, to the
northeast, if you went from D by the road,
it was a good haU-day's work to get there.
The usual manner of performing the journey
was to drive over to one of the raUway
stations on the banks of the Lone, and from
thence proceed by rail to the post town
nearest to the chateau itseU, whence a
vehicle could be despatched to meet you.  
  
  
  This was Monsieur Eichard's mode of
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 22 -->
proceeding, and it had now become his
habit, when he went over to inspect his
futme residence, to pass one night always,
and occasionally two or three, at the
chateau. It took four hours of tolerably
good driving, with a rest of half-an-hour at
the haU-way auberge, to get from D to
the station, and another good hour and a
haU were requned before landing you at the
hall door of ChateaubreviUe. The
expedition, therefore, was not possible in the short
days of whiter. But Monsieur Eichard was
growing very anxious that his future wife
should give her opinion upon some of the
interior arrangements of what was to be her
home, and his anxiety would, if he had
dared, have been tiresome; as it was, it was
only fidgety, and he was for ever recurring
to his fear lest too much delay would be
<!-- Leaf 37, Page: 23 -->
engendered by the want of certain details
being positively fixed upon. March was
drawing to an end, and the weather had, for
the last ten days, been singularly fine, the
genial warmth of the sun bringing forth
vegetation in what was an exceptional
manner even for the soft climate of western
France.


It was decided to take a journey to
Monsieur Eichard's new estate, but to take it in
a form that should not awaken the curiosity
of the inhabitants of D Monsieur
Eichard himself was to go over to
Chateaubreville the day before, pass the night there,
and prepare everything for the reception of
the Vicomte and his daughters on the
morrow. The remarkable old conveyance
which, ni the days of the Eestoration, had
been a caleche, drawn by two stout
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 24 -->
percherons, was ordered out, ancl Baptiste, m
his time-worn livery, prepared to get all the
work he could out of the one aged horse
which on such like occasions had the honour
of transporting the Verancour equipage of
state from place to place.


Why his master and his family were
going early in the morning to the N 
station Baptiste did not guess, which was
no wonder, seeing that Baptiste was not
bright; but the lynx-eyed Suzette, his
better half, did not guess it either, which
was wonderful. So the Vicomte and the
two gnls really did accomplish then journey
without all the gossips in D knowing
whither they were bent, and the general
opinion was that they had gone to see the
Mere Superieure of a very famous convent
on the Nantes Line, in order to arrange for
<!-- Leaf 39, Page: 25 -->
the noviciate of Mademoiselle Vevette, who
was all but certain one day to take the veil.


The N station was reached, the down
train duly caught, and the party safely set
down at the village where Monsieur Eichard
was to be found in waiting. And there he
was sure enough, and all four packed
themselves into the vehicle he had brought for
then convenience; and the big, finely gilt
clock just over the vestibule door was
striking one when they got out at what was one
day to be FeUcie's future home.


The few hours aUotted to the visitors—
they were forced to leave again at a Uttle
after five—were, as you wfll easily conceive,
amply employed by all they had to see.
FeUcie proved herseU thoroughly equal to
the duties of her future position, and
inspected everything as though she had all
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 26 -->
her life been the mistress of a large house,
and reigned over a numerous establishment.
Nothing was beyond or beneath her;
nothing, in fact, out of her competency.
She dived down into the kitchens, and
soared up into the attics, authoritatively
decreeing what was requisite for each
individual servant as long as he or she was " in
tbe exercise of their functions" for the
master's benefit, and how little was sufficient
for them when they were consigned to the
privacy of then own rooms. She was
brilliant on the subject of pantries, larders,
and store-closets, and hit upon all the dry
corners in which it was best to keep
provisions and linen; and in thc wash-houses
absolute inspnation visited her, and she
overturned aU the plans which had been
adopted for heating the caldrons,
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 27 -->
substitutmg for them others which were, as she
victoriously showed, far more economical.
The architect who had been appointed to
meet tbem, and wbo knew nothing of the
names of the persons with whom he spoke,
was penetrated with admnation of the wise
and omniscient Felicie, and could not help
repeating at every fresh defeat of his
combinations by her suggestions—"Voila une
petite dame bien entendue ! "


Poor Vevette felt, as usual, thoroughly
crushed into nothing by her sister's
superiority. So did the Vicomte; but then he
liked it, which Vevette did not. No true
woman can bear to think of herseU as
femininely inferior, that is, inferior in those
qualities which constitute a woman. The
decision and practical abiUty of FeUcie
overawed Vevette; and feeling that nothing
<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 28 -->
could ever make her emulate her sister'i
virtues, she began to regard herseU as
useless, that is, incapable of imparting
happiness; and the inevitable consequence was
discouragement and deep seU-dissatisfaction.
Poor Vevette! She resolutely admired
Felicie because she had been told to do so
from childhood upwards, but do what she
would, she felt she could not like her ways.


This visit to ChateaubrevUle was a sore
trial for Monsieur Eichard, for almost aU
the arrangements to which he had been
consenting for four months were disputed
and ni most cases changed. Of course, on
the alterations made in the inside of the
house Monsieur Eichard had never given an
opinion,—he had none,—but had allowed
his architect to go his own way, and the
architect had aimed chiefly at two things—
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 29 -->
filling his own pockets, and giving to the
general aspect of the dweUing a sufficient
air of richness. In neither of these aims
did MademoiseUe FeUcie at all acquiesce,
and she made comparatively short work with
the bourgeois-like splendour which was about
to flaunt from every waU and window of the
"renovated" old place.


\"What on earth has made you think that
the panels in this small drawing-room
should be gUt ?" asked she, smiling, but
with at the same time an air of such
exquisite impertinence that a spectator must
have had a curious idea of what the
husband's lUe would be who would daUy
endure such treatment. "What is the use
of gUdnig here ? "


"It is richer," repUed both Monsieur
Eichard and his architect at once.
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 30 -->

The elegant Felicie curled ber lip, and
used an inexpressibly disdainful accent
whilst echoing the word " richer ! " And she
meant this as much for her own sne as for
Monsieur Eichard, for she could not avoid
seeing that the Vicomte was every bit as
unable to resist the temptation of what was
gaudy as was his base-born son-in-law elect.


\"Why, what would you furnish these
salons with ? " she continued, always
imperturbably smiling, and looking so pretty!
"Would you hang them with crimson
damask ? "


\"Crimson damask is very handsome,"
observed the architect, rather abashed.


\"Then what is to become of your
beautiful old meuble in white wood, and Beauvais
tapestry, which is absolutely priceless for
any connoisseur ? "
<!-- Leaf 45, Page: 31 -->

"WeU," ventured to remark Monsieur
Eichard, " Monsieur and I thought of
putting that into the rooms up-stans,
and "


But she quickly cut him short, and laid
ber law of elegance down, which was
manifestly to be without appeal. " No one but
parvenus," said she, mercilessly, though in
honey-sweet tones, " ever put gilding and
silk or satin stuffs into country houses.
Eichness, or even pomp, is all very weU for
a Paris residence, and in your
drawingrooms hi Paris you can be as lavish of
gold and crimson damask, within a certain
measure, as you choose; but freshness is
the notion that ought to be inspned by the
aspect of a country abode. Eenovate, by
aU means, the old boiseries of these salons,
but keep them what they are; wood, plain
<!-- Leaf 46, Page: 32 -->
wood, white upon pearl grey, and no gold!
—for Heaven's sake, no gold ! "


Monsieur Eichard looked utterly
disappointed, and as if haU his satisfaction in
his wealth were taken from bun. He

pleaded for just a Uttle " show," for here
and there a patch of garish colouring or of
costly material, and finding no other, he
invariably made use of the same argument,
and vaunted the richness of what he
proposed. Against all the delicate-tinted,
though perhaps a little faded, Beauvais and
GobeUns furniture, which Mademoiselle de
Verancour advocated, he opposed his bran
new, gorgeous tissues, of which he lugged
about a huge roll of patterns. " See how
rich this is ! " he repeatedly said.


\"But it is bad in taste!" was the only
answer he got, and this answer reduced him
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 33 -->
to silence. And so it was with everything.
What he had thought fan or fitting was not
discussed, or superseded by something saner
or more fitting; but the standard by which
he could by any possibility judge of its
fittingness or fanness was not explained to
him. He was put from the starting-point
out of the pale of whatsoever was connected
with taste!


And I don't say that, from the artistic
point of view, MademoiseUe FeUcie was
wrong, for I am tolerably certain that no
teaching and no change of habits could ever
have given Eichard Prevost the fine
perceptions that are requisite to be able to
judge the beauty of external objects, just
as probably no mere cncumstance would
have ever destroyed them in FeUcie. But
it was a hard case, for here were this man  
  
  
  VOL. II. D
<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 34 -->
and this woman about to enter upon a
compact to exist side by side during the term
of then natural lives, without one single
point in then respective modes of lUe
being otherwise than calculated to keep them
morally asunder.


They went through the' house, up-stans
and down-stans, and every step made it
evident how perfectly at home Felicie
would be ni this fine old mansion when she
came to be its mistress, and how no amount
of mastership would ever make of Eichard
Prevost anything else save an intruder.
But though each, perhaps, may have
instinctively felt this, neither saw in it
anything which appeared like a warning, and
the man was as ready as before to buy the
wUe who would despise him, and the wife
equally ready to accept the husband with
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 35 -->
whom whUe she lived she could never have
one single moment's community of thought.


They rambled through the gardens and
shrubberies, and visited greenhouses and
poultry-yards and stables, and here, as
indoors, the captivating FeUcie promulgated
her dogmas, and put out of the question all
attempt at a retort or a counter-objection by
the fatal sentence: "It is not the proper
thing," or "It is bad taste."


When the time came for going,
Mademoiselle FeUcie was well pleased with her
expedition, and when she stepped into the
vehicle which was to take them back to the
station, she felt that upon the whole she
had spent a pleasant day. Monsieur Eichard
could not make up his mind as to whether
the day had been altogether a pleasant one
to him, and for the first time since they
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 36 -->
had met, the future father and son-in-law
cherished a sort of mutual sympathy; for
they had been equaUy snubbed by the same
person.


At the N station who should they
meet but the Cure of D, who had been
sent for by the bishop, and was returning to
his parish by a late train. They made him
the offer of a fifth place in the venerable
old caleche, which necessitated the pitiless
squeezing together of the two young ladies,
but thoroughly convinced Baptiste that the
object of the journey had really been the
convent at which Mademoiselle Vevette
would one day take the veil.


It was striking seven when they started
on then homeward course, but the old
horse, eager for his stables, did bis best,
and Baptiste affirmed that they should reach
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 37 -->
D before tbe four hours usually
required would be over. The night was a
warm but windy one; fitful, as the finest
nights in early spring are wont to be, and
after the moon had sUvered the whole road
before them and the tall trees along its edge,
her light would be suddenly eclipsed by the
dusky veU of some swiftly drUting clouds.
\"We are going through your property here,
are we not, Monsieur le Vicomte ?" asked
the Cure, as the carriage jolted out of a
very iU-repaned by-way into a tolerably
smooth road sknted by young woods.


\"No, no; that's none of mine," was the
reply. " I wish it were. Les Grandes
Bruyeres Ue much higher up to the left.
We have just come across old Eiviere's
fields, and at this moment we are entering
on Monsieur Eichard's woods."
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 38 -->
  
  "A valuable property," suggested the

Cure.


\"Humph ! " grunted the Vicomte. "Yes,
valuable enough, but atrociously ill kept, I
must say."


\"What can one do ?" objected Monsieur
Eichard. "It would be the work of an
active stout-bodied man to superintend the
cuttings hereabouts. I know that, and
old Prosper is assmedly not fit for the
post; but if I were to turn him away
what would become of the old fellow?
He is aUeady in a very shaky state of
health."


"More than that even, Monsieur Eichard,"
repUed the Cure; "the man seems to me
absolutely shattered; he is so wasted away
as to be but the shadow of himself; and his
temper is strangely gloomy."
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 39 -->

\"Have you seen him lately ? " inquned
Monsieur Eichard eagerly.  
  
  
  " Not very lately,—and you ? "


\"Oh ! I never see him," was the prompt
rejoinder. " When he comes, he sees'
Madame Jean, or he goes to the notary."


\"Poor old man ! " said Vevette gently;
\"his must be a sad lUe up all alone there
Ui his woods. Was he always quite alone
ni the world ? "


\"As long as I have known him, always,"
answered Monsieur Eichard.


\"Yes," added the Cure, " and as far as I
know, he was always of the same unsociable
disposition; a born solitane, but, after his
fashion, sincerely pious."  
  
  
  " Poor old man ! " said Vevette again.


The carriage rolled and jolted on, and the
tlnrd quarter past ten was just to be heard
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 40 -->
from the chinch belfry as it came upon tbe
stones at the entrance into D " There
ends my land," said Monsieur Eichard, as
he pointed to a steep wooded bank just
outside the town which sloped down into the
road. "Up that little path you can go on
to the very top of the hUl and past M.
Eiviere's new farm."


"And straight up to old Prosper's hut,"
added the Vicomte. " I know the road well,
and take it often out shooting. There's
somebody coming down it now;—just look !
It never can be old Prosper at this. hour."
The moon at this moment was shining very
brightly, and gave plainly to view the figure
of a man coming out of the little winding
path into the road. He was evidently
about to cross it, but was stopped by the
advance of the old horse that was
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 41 -->
trotting forward under Baptiste's whip. He
drew up and waited. The carriage passed,
and as it did so the moonbeams feU full
upon his face.  
  
  
  "Why, it's Eaoul! " exclaimed FeUcie.


\"Nonsense ! " said her father. " Eaoul's
in Paris doing his office work."


\"Besides, what should he be about in the
middle of the night on a lonely path leading
only through my woods ? " muttered
Monsieur Eichard. " I don't suppose he has
conferences with Prosper up hi his hut."


\"I don't mind that," continued FeUcie;
\"it was Eaoul."


Vevette felt a shudder go through her
whole being, without knowing what it was
that affrighted her.
<!-- Leaf 56 -->
  
  CHAPTEE XVI.  
  
  
  THE LITANIES FOR THE DEAD.

A few days went by, and it was found to
have really been Eaoul de MorviUe whom
the Verancours had seen corning down into
the road on the night of then return from
ChateaubrevUle. But the way in which this
was found out was rather strange, and did
not leave a very satisfactory impression.
Eaoul had called upon the Vicomte, and
stated that a sudden illness of his father's
had summoned him from Paris, and that he
had obtained a month's leave of absence
<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 43 -->
from his office. Old MorviUe had had a
kind of paralytic seizure, and was very weak
and ailing; but no one in D had heard
of this, for Uttle or no intercourse was kept
up between the inhabitants of the town and
those of La MorvUUere.


"When did you come, Eaoul?" asked
FeUcie, carelessly.  
  
  
  " On Wednesday," was the answer.


\"Why, Eaoul," was the rejoinder, with
a mocking smfle, " you positively do not
know what you are saying. You came on
Tuesday, and you have been here four whole
days without coming to see us. Oh ! don't
deny it, for we saw you on Tuesday night
coming down into the road by the path
leading from the woods. Surely you must
have remarked us. You must have
recognised Baptiste in the moonlight."
<!-- Leaf 58, Page: 44 -->

Eaoul looked singularly annoyed and
embarrassed, and at last ended by admitting
that he had arrived on the Tuesday night,
and that, not finding the D diligence
at the station, he had come on foot, taking
a short road across the hill and through the
woods.


\"Short road, tf you will, my lad,"
observed the Vicomte; " but it's a good
fourteen miles' walk."


\"And I really cannot think how you
came not to see the carriage. The moon was
quite bright just then," persisted FeUcie.


"Well, I think I remember that I did
see a carriage," replied young MorvUle;
\"but I certainly did not recognise the man
who was driving it. I suppose I was
thinking of something else."  
  
  
  "You must have been deeply absorbed
<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 45 -->
in your thoughts then," exclaimed Felicie;
\"for Baptiste is not precisely a microscopical
personage, and you have known him ever
since he used to wheel us altogether up
and down the garden hi his barrow."


Eaoul was evidently uncomfortable,
Felicie was maUcious in her playfulness, and
Vevette was miserable, she neither knew
why nor wherefore. The whole was
unsatisfactory and odd. Every one thought
so, but no one said it.


Vevette felt that some harm threatened
Eaoul de MorvUle. What might be its
nature, or whence it came, she knew not,
but the instinct was as strong as it was
sure; and from the moment in which this
unmistakable touch of reality came upon
her, all the fictions of her education flew to
the winds. Eaoul was in danger, and now
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 46 -->
she knew how she loved him. What the
danger was, what the harm that menaced
him,—that she could not define; but in the
dread of his having to pass through some
hard and terrible suffering, everything else
was lost to her sight. She did not stop to
discuss whether it was wrong to love thus;
she did not ask herseU even whether she
should ever be Eaoul's wtfe; she simply
felt that she would risk lUe, happiness,
everything, sooner than that barm should
come to him.


Eaoul had avowed,—or rather he had
not denied to her, on the last day when
they met,—that he had some "trouble."
What was it? How could she find out?
How could she help him ? Poor Vevette's
experience of lUe was as limited as that
of a chUd, and all that she did know led
<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 47 -->
her to suppose that no one had any
grief unconnected with money. From her
earliest memory she had always heard talk
of money, and been forced to conclude
from what she heard that the aim of every
one's Use was to keep his own money and
add to it that of other people. It is true
she had been invariably taught that the
mere possessors of wealth were to be
despised, and that honour was due alone
to good birth; but, at the same time,
she had had it strongly impressed on her
that the weU-born were somehow or other
to be made rich, and that in then
achievement of riches lay the perfect fitness of
tilings.


Vevette's mere judgment, then, told her
that Eaoul was probably suffering some
grievous pecuniary embarrassment; but
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 48 -->
something beyond her judgment, higher
than it, told her it was a peril of a graver
kind that threatened him. She haU
determined to consult the Cure, but hesitated
for many reasons, one of which was, that
Monsieur le Cure himseU was just then
not so accessible as usual, but seemed to
be almost out of temper, and to hold
converse unwillingly with those who sought
him. On the other hand, Eaoul came but
seldom to the Chateau, declaring that his
father took up his whole time; and when
he did come, Vevette's stolen glances at
him were met by looks so mournful in then
lovingness, that misery and dread entered
deeper and deeper into the poor child's
heart. What could be impending ?


The Cure had remarked that for many
weeks the Breton woodcutter bad neglected
<!-- Leaf 63, Page: 49 -->
attending mass, and though it was not his
custom either to note down those who
remained away from church, or to think
less well of them because they did so, still,
the peculiar character of Prosper Morel,
and his strong superstitious tendencies, made
it strange that he should thus absent
himself for a continued length of time from all
celebration of divine worship.


One morning in April Monsieur le Cure
sallied forth after early mass, and took a
turn through the market-place. It was
market-day, and all the housekeepers of
the town and its environs were busy
haggling and clamouring over their bargains.
Madame Jean was busier and more
authoritative than any one else, for she had the
countenance of military authority wherever
she went, and woe betide any luckless  
  
  
  VOL. II. E
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 50 -->
peasant woman who might attempt to gain,
no matter how little, upon the weight of
what she sold, or prevaricate upon the
freshness of eggs, butter, or poultry. She
would have had to settle accounts with the
brigadier, who, on market days, was almost
always to be seen in the near
neighbourhood of Madame Jean, lending her an
importance wdlich neither she nor those about
her disdained. But the sword yields
precedence to the Church, and " Monsieur
Frederi" fell back respectfully when he
saw Monsieur le Cure approaching Madame
Jean.


\"I wish you would tell me what you
know of old Prosper Morel," were the first
words addressed by the parish priest to
Eichard Prevost's housekeeper. " As far
as I have remarked, he has been more
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 51 -->
than two months without coming to church;
for him that is odd."


Madame Jean looked the Cure full in
the face. " Two months ! " echoed she;
\"why, saving your reverence, I don't
believe he's put his foot there for—for—
let me see," and she counted on her fingers,
\"one, two, three, four, five—yes, five,"
and then she mumbled, " March, February,
January, December, November—five full
months. I don't believe, Monsieur le Cure,
that old Prosper has ever been inside the
church since the day of the Feast for the
Dead."


\"Impossible !" retorted the Cure. " I'm
quite certain I've seen him since then."


\"So you may, but not in church. Seen
him ! Oh yes, so have I, too;—but how ?
Hulking and skulking about, crawling
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 52 -->
along close to the walls, and never speaking
to mortal creature, but making off, if you
see him, like an owl with the daylight let
in upon him !"


"But Prosper is a good Christian," urged
the Cure. "He never would stay away
from church in that way."


Madame Jean turned up her nose, and
sniffed the air with a look of something
like indignation.


\"Church, indeed !" she exclaimed.
\"WTiy, Monsieur le Cure, if one is to
believe all one hears, the old savage—those
Bas-Bretons are no better—has been and
built himself some sort of a church or
chapel of his own, where he keeps up a
psalm-singing and a howling day and night,
just as if he were a heretic, neither more
nor less."
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 53 -->

\"Have you spoken to Monsieur Eichard
about him ?" inquired the Cure very
calmly, and in no wise allowing himself
to be prejudiced.


"Well now, really, Monsieur le Cure,"
retorted Madame Jean, "where would be
the good of speaking to Monsieur Eichard ?
Primo, he's always for showing every
indulgence towards old Prosper, under
pretence that he was nursed by Prosper's wife;
and, secundo, he don't get stronger or
better able to bear worry than he used to
be. He's very weak indeed, is Monsieur
Eichard, and nobody knows the trouble
I have with him only to persuade him to
eat a little wholesome soupe grasse, or a
white of a chicken, and not to be always
stuffing himself with sweets, creams, and
jellies, and sugar-plums, that only turn on
<!-- Leaf 68, Page: 54 -->
his stomach and make him sickly, and
shivery, and fractious, just like a baby!
And that's what he is, poor Monsieur
Eichard; for all the world, just like a
baby!"


Wliile Madame Jean was delivering
herself of this harangue, the Cure had been
apparently communing wdth himself rather
earnestly. With one hand thrust into the
pocket of his soutane, he employed the other
in shifting his black calotte about upon his
big head, now bringing it down to his very
nose, and then pushing it back to the nape
of his neck. Then he suddenly fished up a
blue checked cotton handkerchief from the
dept"hs of his pocket, blew his nose
vigorously, put the kerchief back, rammed
both his hands into his pockets, said, "Bon
jour, Madame Jean" rather abruptly, and
<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 55 -->
marched off, across the Place, to the side
street which led him up to his own
dwelling.


A quarter of an hour later, Monsieur le
Cure might be seen, with his broad-brimmed
hat upon his head, and a good strong stick
in his hand, walking over the stones to the
spot where they cease at the entrance into
the town of D The day was bright
and warm, soft and sunny, and though it
was only the first week in April, there was
green everywhere,—that beautiful, delicate
green through which the sun shines so
pleasantly, and which is so suggestive of
youth,—the youth of the year. Wken
Monsieur le Cure got upon the high road,
he suddenly turned to the left, and struck
into the little path that led up the bank,
and passed, as we have already been told,
<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 56 -->
through Eichard Prevost's woods. He
walked on up the hill till at the top he
reached a flat part of the country, divided
between cornfields and woods; and skirting
a field where the young wheat was just
beginning to throw its verdant robe over
the brown earth, he plunged completely
into the shade of the woods, and made for
the plantations of tall timber.


In the middle of a clearing, which our
pedestrian soon reached, ten long and
tolerably straight alleys met, and a board nailed to
the stem of a beech-tree informed you that
this was called " L'Etoile des dix routes."
Between two of these forest avenues, and
backed by thick towering woods, in which
the axe had not been busy for some years,
stood a solid, well-enough built woodman's
hut. The door was well-hinged, and the
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 57 -->
window-panes unbroken. All looked to be
in fairly good order. This was Prosper
Morel's abode, and Monsieur le Cure went
straight up to the door, knocked at it, and
got no answer. He tried to open it. It
was locked. He examined the two
windows. The board serving as a shutter was
up at both. Monsieur le Cure walked
round and round, and called Prosper with a
loud voice, but got no answer. All was
still, and as Monsieur le Cure had had a
good stout walk, and had left home before
the hour at which he usually partook of his
second breakfast, he felt hungry, and not
undesirous of a little repose. He seated himself
on the log of a felled tree, and took from
his pocket a large slice of bread, a piece of
cheese, and a book. When he had eaten
the bread and cheese, he betook himself to
<!-- Leaf 72, Page: 58 -->
the book, and read, and rested himself for
half an hour. At last he rose, and looked
again on all sides, and called, but still no
one came; and so Monsieur le Cure got up
to go home, saying to himself, " I can make
out nothing that looks like a chapel." He
proceeded home leisurely and musingly,
and every now and then stopping to take
off his hat, and rub bis hand over his
forehead.


He had got more than half way upon his
journey back to D, when he heard what
he supposed to be the call of one woodsman
to another, or of a shepherd to his dog. He
stopped and listened. It was very
indistinct; but still he heard it again. It
seemed to be a good way off, and to come
from the part where the woods were thickest,
At last he clearly made out that the
<!-- Leaf 73, Page: 59 -->
direction he was taking led him nearer to the
sound, and he pursued his path, listening,
stopping, and then instinctively holding his
breath, in order to listen better. The sound
was an inexplicable one—something between
a moan and a yell; and as the Cure got
nearer, he perceived that it was, in fact, a
succession of continuous sounds, and that
when the louder cries ceased, they were
exchanged for a rapid droning sort of
utterance, which at first he could not rightly
understand. The wood grew very thick as
he advanced, and the path very narrow,
winding through tangled brushwood and
briars, and extremely damp under foot.


For a moment or two the sounds had
ceased, but the Cure kept on his path
cautiously, for fear of being heard. Through a
break in the bushes he now saw a small
<!-- Leaf 74, Page: 60 -->
open space where the grass grew high, and
at one end of which had been raised a
species of shed. It was a queer, rude kind
of construction, thatched with straw, quite
open as far as one half of it went, and the
other half was rudely and imperfectly closed
by very clumsily made hurdles. The Cure
had hardly had time to render to himself an
account of what he saw, when the chanting
recommenced.


It was the Litanies for the dead. The
droned or muttered parts were the repeated
appeals of the actual Litany, whilst the
words "Libera me!" were shouted out
with terror-stricken force, and with what
was really sometimes a perfect yell.


At first the Cure could not see the man
who chanted the dismal invocation, for he
was seemingly behind the shed, but a few
<!-- Leaf 75, Page: 61 -->
seconds brought him to view. It was old
ProsperMorel, who, with a crucifix in his
hands, strode round and round the shed,
at a solemn measured pace, and as though
following the procession before Mass on All
Souls' Day. The woodcutter was so altered
that he looked as though twenty years had
passed over him. The flesh had apparently
dried up, and only wrinkled skin covered
the bony structure of the man. The joints
seemed absolutely monstrous, and knees,
ankles, shoulders, elbows, and wrists stood
out in huge disproportion to the shrunk and
dwindled portions of the frame they held
together. The nose was a very vulture's
beak, rising between the two sharp
protruding cheek-bones that literally overhung the
hollow cavities where the cheeks had sunk
in. But what struck you more than all
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 62 -->
were the eyes. Naturally enlarged by the
shrinking of the flesh from the other
features, their balls seemed starting from their
sockets. But it was less the glare of the
eyes that arrested your attention than their
fixity. They appeared invariably to stare
at some one object, and the lids did not look
as though they could ever close over the
eyes themselves.


What with his emaciation, and the
patched and tattered condition of his
raiment, Prosper was a grim object as he
went stalking round and round, staring
through space, with his crucifix clutched
with both hands, close to his breast, and
chanting the Litanies for the dead.


The Cure resolved to watch minutely
the movements of the man, and his
whereabouts, before coming forward to make
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 63 -->
himself known. Accordingly, therefore, as
the Breton went to this side or that, he,
too, shifted his hiding-place, going from
behind one large tree to another. What
he saw was this;—there, where the shed
was open, there was visible inside it, and
at the back, under the slope of the roof, a
sort of chapel. Several large logs of wood
piled up together, and covered with a sheet,
made a kind of altar, and on this were
grouped specimens of most of the things
used in connection wdth the ceremonies of
the Church. There were images of every
description, large and small, in wood and
in wax; images of the Yirgin and of our
Saviour, and of various Saints. There were
candlesticks of copper, brass, and tin, with
tapers in them; and hung all round there
were pictures of Holy Families or Martyrs,
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 64 -->
such as you buy from pedlars and hawkers
for a few sous.


The back of the shed was formed by a
flat blank wall of planks coarsely nailed
together and painted black, on which were
drawn in wThite chalk a most confusing
mass of hieroglyphical signs and figures,
disjointed words, huge capital letters, verses
of Psalms, and uncouth portraitures of
human beings.


AYhile the Cure was busy trying to make
out what these extraordinary drawings
could mean, the chanting ceased, and in
a few minutes the bucheron came round
with heavy, drawling steps, without his
crucifix, but with something in his hand
which the Cure could not distinguish. His
eyes were still fixed on vacancy, and he
was muttering a prayer half aloud. He
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 65 -->
walked straight up to the blackened wall,
rubbed out a string of words and figures
with his sleeve, and wdth what he held in
his right hand began to write down others
in their place. The operation was a slow
one, but by degrees, as the Cure watched,
he saw grow under the old man's fingers
the phrase—  
  
  
  t  
  
  
  " De profundis clamavi


Just then rang out clearly in the distance
the chimes of the church of D, and
the twelve strokes marking the hour of
noon. This proved to Monsieur le Cure
that he was nearer to the town than he
had at first supposed.


He determined now to try the effect of
personal communication, and stepping
forward from behind the cover of his tree, he  
  
  
  VOL. II. F
<!-- Leaf 80, Page: 66 -->
addressed the man. "Prosper Morel," said
he, coming straight up to the bucheron,
"what is it you are doing here?" The
old man sprang back with an agility you
could not have imagined to belong to him,
and then suddenly, as it were, collapsed
altogether, and fell down at the root of
a tall sycamore, huddled up, and with only
his two arms stretched out to their utmost
length, as though to ward off some attack.
\"Prosper," repeated the Cure, coming
closer, but speaking very gently, " I have
not come to harm you. Tell me why you
are here?"


But, seemingly, speech was impossible,
for the woodcutter only writhed and
gibbered, and stretched out his hands
against the intruder more and more. At
last, by a violent effort, he raised himself
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 67 -->
against the trunk of the tree, and stood
upright, glowering at the Cure, whose
quiet persistence nevertheless appeared to
be acting magnetically upon him.


After a few minutes' struggling, speech,
though imperfect, came; and then, with
a scream of terror, he spoke. "Master!
master!" shrieked Prosper, "I won't go
alone with you! Take him too;—take
him!"


"Do you not know me, Prosper Morel?"
asked the Cure, as he thought he
perceived some sign of wavering in the man's
eye.


"Yes! yes!" he gasped in agony,
clasping his hands with convulsive energy.
\"Know you ? yes! It is you who told
him to come for me,—told me he would
come, and look at me face to face,—but
<!-- Leaf 82, Page: 68 -->
I won't go;" — and he threw his arms
behind him fiercely, round the trunk of
the tree;—" I won't go alone with him !
Tell him to take the other too,—the other,
—the other!Tell him to take him!"
And then his hold relaxed, his knees
knocked together, his body bent
forwards, and he dropped senseless to the
ground.


WTien Monsieur le Cure reached his
home that afternoon he was no wiser than
he had been when he left it. He felt that
there was something wrong somewhere;
but what seemed to him the most evident
result of the whole was that, with his
sermon on All Souls' Day, he had
completely deranged the old woodcutter's
already weak intellect.
<!-- Leaf 83, Page: 69 -->
  
  But was Prosper only mad ? or... ?  
  
  
  
It was a terrible question, and Monsieur
le Cure was sorely perplexed.
<!-- Leaf 84 -->
  
  CHAPTEE XYII.  
  
  
  IS HE MAD?

Yes, indeed, Monsieur le Cure was sorely
perplexed. The more he thought of it the
more he felt persuaded that there was
something beyond mental derangement in old
Prosper's behaviour. Of proof of this,
when the Cure came to cross-examine
himself as to what he had actually seen and
heard, he could find none. Prosper had
always been a strange, gloomy man,
weakwitted and superstitious, and nothing was
more likely than that what had happened
<!-- Leaf 85, Page: 71 -->
since his master's death should have
completely upset his reasoning faculties. Any
doctor accustomed to treat lunatics would
regard it as quite an ordinary case; and yet,
in spite of this, the Cure felt that there was
more and worse in it than this came to, and
the thought pursued and haunted him day
and night.


In order to recall more clearly to his
mind all the minutest circumstances
connected with the murder of Martin Prevost,
the Cure contrived, very ingeniously as he
thought, to provoke conversation upon that
subject with all those who had at the time
been called upon to investigate the case.
From all that he could gather by talking to
the Maire, and the Juge de Paix, and the
Doctor, and the brigadier de gendarmerie,
never was a fact more satisfactorily
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 72 -->
estaWished than that the murder of Martin
Prevost was committed by some one from
without,—some one whose mere object was
to rob the old man of his money, and who
had successfully escaped all pursuit.


As to Prosper Morel,—beyond what
had led to his arrest, namely, the fact of
his having a short time previously vowed
vengeance upon his master for an offence
which was shown to have been condoned
and forgotten, — beyond that one fact,
nothing in all the evidence collected pointed
at him; and, on the contrary, the whole of
that evidence had so thoroughly excluded
any notion of his culpability, that his
imprisonment was a subject of regret to
every one; for it was generally supposed
that it had had a fatal effect upon the old
Breton's mind and health.
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 73 -->

The incident which had, at the time,
struck every one as alone likely to afford a
clue to the criminal, had remained wholly
unfathomable. The footsteps, namely,
which led from the house to the garden,
and ceased on the edge of the little stream,
or rather ditch, close to the Cholet high
road, had never been made to coincide with
boot or shoe wearable by any individual
connected far or near with old Prevost or
his house.


\"I know what I have thought sometimes
since then," said one day the brigadier de
gendarmerie, in a moment of supreme
confidence; "but one never likes to cast a
suspicion on any one;—above all, when
one belongs to the Executive authority!"
And Monsieur Frederi drew himself up
majestically.
<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 74 -->

"Did you suspect any one in D,
then?" asked the Cure, with a shudder.


\"At the time, no," was the reply; " but
since, I have often thought that " he
paused. "Well, Monsieur le Cure, to you
I don't mind confiding my secret thoughts.
If I had been Monsieur le Juge
d'lnstruction, I would have had that sharper, Leon
Duprez, arrested." And as he uttered these
last words he lowered his voice.


\"Leon Duprez?" echoed the Cure, with
a start of surprise; " why, what could
possibly make you suspect him ? "


\"Nothing, Monsieur le Cure; I repeat it,
at the time, nothing; but have you never
reflected that he left D immediately
after the crime, and we now know under
what circumstances he left it, and what a
pressing need he must have been under at
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 75 -->
that identical moment for a few thousand
francs?"


The Cure stared at the gendarme in mute
astonishment.


"Yes," continued the latter; "my
suspicion is so strong, that if the scoundrel
were not away in Australia, if he were
anywhere within my reach, I would now do
everything in my power to get him arrested,
so persuaded do I feel that, in some way or
other, he had to do with the murder of old
Monsieur Prevost."


This was a totally new light to the Cure,
and only contributed to perplex him more
and more; and, strange to say, instead of
delivering him from all preoccupation as far
as the woodcutter was concerned, it only
made those preoccupations more complicated
and less avoidable. What did the Breton
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 76 -->
mean when he raved about "the other?"
Who was that "other?"


Though on the day of his strange
interview with Prosper Morel, up in the woods,
the Cure had ended,—after the bucheron
had regained his senses,—by calming the
old man's agitation, and inducing him to
listen to him quietly enough, still he had
not advanced one step in the direction of
any practical discovery. He had talked to
Prosper for nearly an hour, and could not
avoid thinking he had done him good;
but the principal sign of improvement
on the woodcutter's part was afforded by
silence.


When once Prosper had been brought
to look upon the Cure as a friend, and to
acknowledge him in the flesh as his spiritual
pastor, a certain load appeared to be taken
<!-- Leaf 91, Page: 77 -->
off his mind,—a certain dread to be
mitigated. By degrees, as the Cure spoke and
advised, and tried to soothe and comfort
him, Prosper seemed to undergo a species
of physical relaxation; his nerves ceased
their over-tension, he stretched his arms
and legs as people do after long illness and
fever, and closed his eyes frequently and as
with a sensation of relief.


These signs induced the Cure, while
Prosper was present, to incline towards the
belief that the old man was merely a victim
to temporary insanity, or simply
hallucination brought on by the tragic events with
which he had been indirectly connected, and
kept up by the gloom of his solitary life.
But when he reflected upon Prosper's
conduct, and recurred to his manner, to his
look, to the tone of his voice, an instinct
<!-- Leaf 92, Page: 78 -->
awoke that would not be hushed,—an
instinct that for ever told him there was more
in all this than madness.


All he had gained was, that the wretched
old man had listened to him, and had
seemingly comprehended what he had said.
Naturally, after bringing the Breton to
accept his interference, and to submit to his
counsels, there was, according to the lights
of a sincerely pious Catholic priest, but one
course to which he could endeavour to lead
him;—to confess. He could teach him no
other lesson save that only one: " Eepent,
confess, and thy sins shall be forgiven thee;"
and that lesson he taught him.


The woodcutter listened in silence, but
he more than once muttered to himself,
\"Confess ! confess ! " and he shivered as
with a fit of ague.
<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 79 -->

"And thy sins shall be forgiven thee,"
slowly and impressively added the priest.  
  
  
  But further than that he did not get.


Unfortunately, in small places like D,
nothing can be kept secret, and a distorted
account of the Cure's visit to old Prosper's
abode began to circulate amongst the
gossips. Whence did it come ? Who
knows ? Perhaps from the
brigadier—perhaps from old Lise, " Monsieur le Cure's
Lise," to whom, after fifteen years passed
under the same roof, her master did now
and then just hint that he was troubled or
perplexed. However, circulate the story
did, and with so many embellishments, that
the old Breton was transformed into an
object of popular curiosity, and, as the days
were fine and beginning to lengthen, knots
of mischievous boys would troop off into the
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 80 -->
woods and organise expeditions to "La
Chapelle a Prosper," as they termed it;
and the old man's extraordinary demeanour,
his "mummeries and antics," as they called
them, came to be a grand subject of
diversion for the godless crew.


But the behaviour of the bucheron was
altered now. Instead of 'stalking about
and chanting Psalms and Litanies, as he
had been used to do, he would sit for hours
together, with closed eyes, his chin resting
on his clasped hands, and his elbows on his
knees. He appeared absorbed in
meditation. He was perfectly harmless, and
sought in no way to punish his youthful
tormentors, but almost seemed to look upon
them as a part of the penance he was doomed
to undergo. When he believed himself
most alone he would suddenly hear a
<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 81 -->
mocking voice calling him by name, and as he
turned round, a curly pate, or a smudgy
visage, would show itself from behind the
tree-stems or the bushes, and grin and make
faces at him. They popped out upon him
on all sides, dogged his steps, hopped across
his path, and when they had found that he
opposed no resistance to their tricks, they,
with all the cowardice of "little-boy"
nature, set to work to torment him
systematically. Nor was it only the very
small imps who indulged in this occupation.
Their example was soon followed by the
lads of fifteen or sixteen, and to these were
also too often added the lazy loiterers who,
in small provincial towns, have nothing
particular to do except lounge away
their afternoons at the "cafe," reading the
\"Siecle."  
  
  
  VOL. II. G
<!-- Leaf 96, Page: 82 -->

The great amusement was to call upon
the woodcutter to confess. First one, and
then another, would jump out of the
brushwood, and cry out:


\"Why don't you go to confession,
Prosper ?"  
  
  
  " You had better confess ! " would add a

third.


"If you'll only confess to me, Prosper,
I'll give you absolution at once," would
observe a fourth.


And the effect was invariably the same.
The man listened silently, cast a haggard
look around,—very much the look of a
frightened animal,—and then rose, and with
shambling gait went up to his blackened
board behind the shed, and began to write
upon it broken and half-illegible sentences
in white chalk. Once established at this
<!-- Leaf 97, Page: 83 -->
work, nothing disturbed him more. Hours
would elapse, and he would go on
alternately rubbing out words already written,
and writing fresh ones in their place.


Day after day people talked of the
bucheron's madness; and at market, and at
the cafe, it was a common subject of
discourse; but the Cure was more than ever
perplexed, and uneasy in his mind.


"It is a very extraordinary case this of
Prosper Morel's," said he one day to young
Morville, whom he met accidentally walking
towards the High Street of D; "very
extraordinary and perplexing."


\"I see nothing in it either very
extraordinary or very perplexing," replied Eaoul
calmly. " The old man's head was always
a weak one; what has passed has fairly
turned it,—as it well might,—and your
<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 84 -->
own sermon of the Fete des Morts has
supplied the one particular image to which
the diseased brain has clung ever since.
Such cases are far more frequent than you
fancy; above all, with such races as those
Bas-Bretons,—gloomy, and easily led
towards fixed ideas."


\"Eaoul," said the Cure, after a few steps
taken side by side in silence, " old Prosper
is no more mad than you or I. That is my
conviction."


Young Morville expressed his entire
dissent from the Cure's opinion, and they again
walked on together in silence till they
reached the part of the street just opposite
La Maison Prevost. " Good-bye, Eaoul,"
said the Cure, with a slight touch ofsadness. " I am going in there. Good-bye;
I have seen but little of you since you came.
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 85 -->
I hardly think you have come once to the
Presbytere."


\"If you knew what a state my father
was in, you would, perhaps, excuse me,"
rejoined the young man. " I really do not
know even now what decision to take. He
will probably never recover, and my month's
conge is nearly up."


\"And then you must go back to Paris ? "
remarked the Cure. " Or have you any
chance of lengthening your leave ?"


\"I fear not. I have only a week left.
I wish, instead of Paris, I were going to
Australia." The last words were uttered
in a tone of great dejection.


\"To Australia ? " echoed the Cure, with
a start. " Why Australia ? "


\"Only because it is so much farther off,"
said young Morville. But there was a
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 86 -->
bitterness in the look with which he
accompanied the words, and altogether an air
about him that the Cure could not account
for, and that he disliked.


They separated, and Monsieur le Cure,
crossing over to La Maison Prevost, told
Madame Jean, when she opened the door,
that it was absolutely necessary he should
see Monsieur Eichard. "Of course he won't
object to receiving you, but he is very
nervous and weak to-day," was Madame
Jean's reply, as she ushered the Cure into
her master's room. Weak enough and
nervous enough he looked, to be sure, as
he rose from his fireside to greet the parish
priest, and offer him the seat in the opposite
corner.


"No, thank you," said the Cure. "I
should faint from the heat. Your room is
<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 87 -->
an oven. You should open the window,
Monsieur Eichard; such a temperature is
enough to take all the strength out of you."


\"I have none left in me, alas ! " rejoined
Monsieur Eichard in a whining voice. " I
get worse and worse, and I believe I shall
be forced to change the air, and try Cannes
or Hyeres for a few weeks. My cough is
so troublesome, my breathing so bad, and I
cannot sleep."


\"Fine weather will do much, my good
Monsieur Eichard, and we shall soon be
having that; but you must excuse me if
I come to trouble you upon some very sad
business, but where really you are the only
person who can act. Touching old Prosper
Morel "


Monsieur Eichard turned round towards
the fire, and answered fractiously, " Mon
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 88 -->
Dieu ! mon Dieu ! how cruel everybody is !
The poor old creature is mad, stark mad,
and I will not have him molested with
my consent. Do have him left alone. Do
let him do what he likes; he can't live
long, and he hurts nobody."


"Monsieur Eichard," continued the Cure,
gravely—"Prosper is not mad; that is my
deliberate conviction, and he ought, at all
events, to be examined by some medical
man!"


"Not mad, my dear Monsieur le Cure!"
repeated Monsieur Eichard, peevishly.
\"Why, his madness is notorious,—is the
talk of the town. What would be the
use of a doctor?"


"The use of a doctor would be to define
clearly what is the real mental condition
of the man," retorted the Cure. "If he
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 89 -->
is insane, he ought to be shut up and
attended to; if he is not "


"Well, what then?" inquired Monsieur
Eichard, almost angrily. "AYhatthen?"


"Wby, then," rejoined the Cure, slowly,
\"the case ought to be looked into in
another way. Prosper is perfectly calm.
All his vehemence has subsided, but he is
under the impression of some horrible
deed, and he persistently, and day after
day, proclaims himself a murderer."
Monsieur Eichard shrugged his shoulders,
and threw two more logs on the fire.
"Prosper's behaviour is now such as, in
my mind, to call for some notice from
you, Monsieur Eichard, as the nearest
relative of the murdered man. He passes
his days and nights in writing upon the
board behind his strange abode up yonder,
<!-- Leaf 104, Page: 90 -->
the confession of his guilt. Fifty times
over you will see the words, 'Prosper did
it,' written in large characters; and 'God
be merciful to Prosper, the murderer !'"


"And upon such evident marks of
insanity as those, you would persecute a
poor wretch of this kind ?" retorted Eichard
Prevost.


\"That is not all," urged the Cure. " He
invariably alludes to some one else,—says
he was not alone,—says there was another
person mixed up with him in the crime."


"Monsieur le Cure," said Eichard
Prevost, drawing himself closer into the fire,
\"all the circumstances of my poor uncle's
death were minutely investigated at the
time, and if anything was proved, it was
Prosper Morel's innocence; and I will not
have the poor old fellow's last days tortured
<!-- Leaf 105, Page: 91 -->
with my consent. That the murderer of
my uncle escaped is clear. One day,
perhaps, he may be discovered,—people say
murderers always are,—but I should think
it a positive crime to re-institute fresh
proceedings now, upon no surer a basis than
the ravings of a wretched idiot who has
already lost his reason through our first
ill-founded suspicions."


The Cure argued and argued, but could
make no way whatever against Monsieur
Eichard.


\"So you will not take any further
proceedings in this matter ? " said the priest,
when he rose to go.


\"None whatever," answered Eichard
Prevost. " There has been misery enough.
Let poor old Prosper be left in peace. He
won't live long, probably."
<!-- Leaf 106, Page: 92 -->
  
  
As the Cure was passing out of the room,
he turned round with his hand still upon
the door; " Eemember my words,
Monsieur Eichard," he added gravely, " Prosper
Morel is not mad."
<!-- Leaf 107 -->
  
  CHAPTEE XVIII.  
  
  
  ST. MARK'S DAY.

One thing was clear to every one, and that
was, the alteration that had taken place
inyoung Morville. He had used to be so gay
and joyous, so en train, as the French say,
so up to everything ! and now he was,
absorbed and absent, looked exceedingly ill,
and moved about as though oppressed by some
overwhelming care. Far from seeking the
society of any of the people in D, he
apparently avoided all society; for, as the
Cure had truly remarked, he did not go
<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 94 -->
near him, who had been from early youth
his best and surest friend, and he neglected
the family at the Chateau, where he had
hitherto had a second home.


Monsieur de Verancour did not spare his
observations upon Eaoul's conduct, and was
for ever commenting upon it in a way that
terribly alarmed and pained Yevette. " It
is the same with all those young fellows,"
the Vicomte would say; " the very moment
they get up to Paris it's all over. They
tumble into some mischief or other,—mostly
some infamous woman at the bottom of it
all, some Dame aux Camelias, or some
drolesse of the demi-monde, which is even
worse; and then come the string of
embarrassments and misfortunes, play, debts, and
God knows what all. They borrow what
they can't pay, and they know they can't;
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 95 -->
but that's no matter; they go on all the
same, and hope some miracle will be
performed in their favour; and the end of it all
is, the ruin of papa and mamma and the
whole family, who have to pay for the
young gentleman's misdeeds. But when
there is neither papa nor mamma nor family,
the end is another one,—disgrace, or
suicide, or both; mighty lucky when it isn't
dishonour, or the Bagne for forgery : but
it's always the same thing, and if ever I saw
any one who bore all the marks of having
got into a mess, it is Eaoul."


And then the Vicomte usually wound up
by some bitter remarks upon the people of
the present day who go themselves, or send
their sons, up to Paris to make money, and
said how infinitely preferable was the quiet
life and honest mediocrity of the province,
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 96 -->
where your ancestors had lived and died
before you! "It might be dull," opined
the Vicomte self-righteously; "it might be
humdrum, but it was honourable, and
according to the traditions of old French ways
and customs."


Monsieur de Verancour never seemed to
think it otherwise than "highly
honourable " to contemplate the sale of his child
to a man she despised; and such bargains
formed part of what he thought the superior
morality of provincial life.


Now, poor Vevette was breaking her
heart all this while, and suffering
martyrdom in silence. What she heard whispered
about her, and what her father said aloud,
would have been nothing had her own heart
not failed her. But her own heart had told
her, long before others spoke, that
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 97 -->
something was wrong, very wrong, with Eaoul.
A girl, brought up as girls are in France,
may sometimes love quickly, yet be very
long before she knows that she loves. The
everyday life of respectable families is
singularly flat and monotonous, and helps
to lead a girl on from the cradle to the
grave in ignorance of what lies hidden in
her soul. But if once the accident happen,
if once the calm be broken,—beware !


And thus it had been with Vevette; she
had been true to her teachers so long as she
could be so, so long as she lived their life
instead of her own; but as soon as the
measure of her suffering taught her the
measure of her love, as soon as she knew
beyond all doubt that she loved Eaoul better
than everything else upon earth, and that
for his loss Paradise itself would notcomVOL. II. H
<!-- Leaf 112, Page: 98 -->
pensate, then the aspects and the aims and
purposes of her life changed, and she was
another than the self she had hitherto been.
Had any one about her really cared to
discover what was passing in the poor child's
physical and mental condition, the
perturbation would have been easily seen. She had
grown miserably thin from anxiety and
sleeplessness, but her cheek had a flush and
her eye had a brilliancy that misled those
uninterested in her happiness. The
excitement within threw its fever-mantle round
her, and they took it for bloom.


\"How wonderfully well your sister
looks," said the Vicomte to Felicie: " she
is growing extremely handsome. I never
saw her look so well, and she is so lively."
\"Yes," the latter would answer, " she is
even too lively; she is restless and brusque;
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 99 -->
she was not used to be so, but I suppose it
is one of the changes girls sometimes go
through. It is very lucky she is not called
upon to make a great sacrifice for others,—
to immolate herself; for I do not think she
would be equal to it. Vevette is becoming
self-willed; indeed, almost wilful." And so
saying, Mademoiselle Feiicie would sigh,
and look full of compunction for her sister's
sins.


On the 25th of April there was a kind of
fete at D——. It was the feast of St.
Marc, which had been time out of mind
kept as a holiday in that locality, and at
which it was customary that every one in
the neighbourhood should be present. The
amusements of the fete were all grouped
together in the fields that lay between
D and the village of St. Philbert;
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 100 -->
and upon a piece of land visible from the
terrace of the Chateau, ancl called the Pre
St. Marc, were to be found all the usual
attractions of such popular gatherings as
these. There were the menageries, and the
giants and dwarfs, and learned dogs and pigs
and birds, and magicians, and Dutch toupies,
and gingerbread-stalls; and there, also,
wras the space set aside for dancing, under
the wide-spreading boughs of two enormous
chestnut-trees. When night came, all this
was to be illuminated with coloured lamps,
but the festivities of the night were left
chiefly to the enjoyment of the lower orders,
or to individuals of the masculine sex alone
among their betters. The fashionable hour
for attending the fete was late in the
afternoon, from four to six or half-past,—what
determined provincials still called, before
<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 101 -->
supper. At that hour all the notables were
sure to be found congregating together
round the roots of the chestnut-trees, and
either looking on at the dancers or taking
part in the dance; for it was the custom
that upon this occasion there should be a
perfect confusion of ranks.


Monsieur le Maire and his spouse, and
the Juge de Paix, and the notary, and all
the other dignitaries of D, had already
appeared upon the Pre St. Marc, when
the Vicomte was seen approaching with
his two daughters and Monsieur le Cure,
and followed by Eichard Prevost and the
doctor, who had been expressing his
satisfaction at the improvement in Monsieur
Eichard's health. Besides these, there
were several visitors from chateaux in the
environs; and one gossip,—but then that
<!-- Leaf 116, Page: 102 -->
wras that mischievous woman Madame
Josephine le Yaillant, the wife of the Juge
de Paix,—declared she had seen Monsieur
de Champmorin lounging about.


However that may be, Felicie did
assuredly look pretty and graceful enough
to have been wTorth any suitor's wrhile to
woo. As to Yevette, her beauty took
people by surprise, for they were not used
to think anything of her, as the common
phrase runs, and it was strange to be
positively dazzled by what you have never
been taught to regard as a light.


The sisters were dressed nearly alike,
excepting only that the elder wore blue,
and the younger pink ribbons. Both had
on white dresses and straw hats; and
whilst the soft colours of her blue streamers
harmonised so delightfully with Felicie's
<!-- Leaf 117, Page: 103 -->
delicate, even complexion, and light, wavy,
chestnut hair, that you could not help
seeing she had studied her effects, the
rosy hue of Yevette's trimmings, that
would have been so set off by her thick
flaxen tresses, paled under the damask
flush of her burning cheek and the scarlet
of her unquiet lip.


It was a general remark how much
better poor Monsieur Eichard looked, and
everybody seemed glad thereat; for,
excepting the purchase of the little carriage
from Tours, Eichard Prevost had given
no sign of enjoying his wealth, and his
weak health was such an obstacle to his
ever thoroughly enjoying it, that his
neighbours were pleased with him, and
patronised him, and morally patted him on the
back.
<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 104 -->

When the usual observations on the
weather, and the fact of this being the very
finest St. Marc ever remembered, were at
an end, one of the first subjects of general
conversation was the insanity of old Prosper.


"I really am tired to death of hearing
that poor unfortunate old creature talked
of incessantly," said Felicie. "It is
precisely what is so odious in provincial life;
one never hears the last of anything,
however trivial or unimportant it may happen
to be." This remark had been made to
Monsieur le Cure and Eichard Prevost,
who were both standing beside
Mademoiselle de Verancour when she spoke. But
it was also heard by Monsieur le Maire,
who by no means agreed in this system of
disparaging the province.  
  
  
  "It is possible, mademoiselle," said he,
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 105 -->
"that in a great centre like Paris, crime
itself may pass unnoticed, but I am
oldfashioned enough to prefer provincial ways,
and not to quarrel with what after all only
proves an extreme susceptibility to the
state of public morality;" and then he,
too, launched out into a tirade about the
old French ways and customs, and
tradition, and drew from it all the plain
inference that crime was the daily bread
of the Parisians.


\"Crime ! my dear sir," retorted Felicie,
with that peculiar mixture of contempt
and condescension she sometimes assumed,
"but there is no question of crime in all
this; it is a question only of insanity, and
the poor old man up yonder will be
probably worried to death by the gossips of
D"
<!-- Leaf 120, Page: 106 -->

\"I assure you, mademoiselle," persisted
the Maire, "it is a most extraordinary case,
if all that is reported be true."


The Cure and Eichard Prevost had left
the little group to speak to some fresh
arrivals from St. Philbert, and the Vicomte,
who had rejoined his daughters, now took
part in the conversation. "It really does
seem to me," said he, "that what it is
the fashion now to call the public, does,
as usual, meddle most impertinently in
what does not concern it. Surely as long
as the one person who is alone entitled
to interfere remains silent, no one else has
any right to raise his voice. If Monsieur
Eichard is convinced of that miserable old
man's innocence, whose business can it
possibly be to accuse or suspect him ?"
But the Maire was inclined to support the
<!-- Leaf 121, Page: 107 -->
cause of what he called public justice,
and he was beginning to argue the point
with the Vicomte, when the band charged
with the musical department of the fete
plunged with such diabolical energy into
a contre-danse, that no more talk was just
then practicable.


Monsieur le Maire requested the honour
of Mademoiselle Felicie's hand, whilst—
the Mairesse being infirm and unable to
dance—Monsieur de Verancour performed
vis-a-vis to them with a very portly and
consequential personage, Madame Valentin,
the grocer's wife, out and out the richest
bourgeoise in D, and reputed to
entertain the most advanced opinions both
in religion and politics. It had even been
whispered that Madame Valentin was
encouraging her husband to lend money to
<!-- Leaf 122, Page: 108 -->
a certain lawyer of Eepublican tendencies,
who dreamed of setting up a liberal
newspaper, to be called "Le Drapeau du
Departement," with a view to waging war upon
the Prefet's pet organ. However,
notwithstanding her political bias, the epicier's
spouse seemed well pleased with her
cavalier, for she laughed with all her
teeth, which were fine, as she ducked
down through the chaine anglaise, and
came back with evident glee to her partner
after an en-avant-deux.


Meanwhile our friend Madame Jean had
been led forth among the side couples by
the brigadier, who was observed invariably
to encircle her waist with his arm and
perform a pirouette a la militaire with her,
each time that the figure of the quadrille
placed him face to face with his partner.
<!-- Leaf 123, Page: 109 -->
\"She won't marry him any more for all
that," whispered the lanky over-grown son
of the Juge de Paix to Mere Jubine's
Louison, with whom he was dancing.


But Louison was busy admiring Monsieur
Eichard.


Yes! there was some one for whom
Eichard Prevost was not "poor Monsieur
Eichard;" some one for whom he was a
grand gentleman, and the type of all
elegance and fashion!


As we have said, Eichard Prevost was
not ill-looking; he appeared to be weakly,
—that was all,—and was pre-eminently
what the Provencal terms " not much of a
man;" but for the old washerwoman's
daughter, herself the very handsomest girl
of her class in D, this very delicacy
was refinement; and Monsieur Eichard,
<!-- Leaf 124, Page: 110 -->
with his blond hair elaborately curled by
the coiffeur, and his glossy whiskers, his
blue cravat, and pale lilac kid gloves, his
superb watch-chain, and with clouds of
perfume over all, was the very finest
gentleman she had ever seen, or would ever have
a chance of seeing. And so Mere Jubine's
Louison was all eyes for Monsieur Eichard,
and paid no attention to what the
palefaced lanky son of the Juge de Paix was
saying to her about Madame Jean and hei
military lover.


Just before the contre-danse had begun,
Eaoul de Morvillc had passed close to the
group where the Vicomte and his daughters
were standing. Greetings had been
exchanged, and as Monsieur le Maire carried
off Felicie as his partner, Vevette had
turned round as if with a sudden impulse:—
<!-- Leaf 125, Page: 111 -->
\"Have you forsworn dancing, Eaoul ?" she
asked, trying to smile very gaily. "We
used always to dance together at the St.
Marc when we were children."


"Shall we do so now?" was the
answer; and Eaoul went towards the dancers
with Vevette on his arm.


While they danced together, they never
spoke once, but once their hands met; hers
lingered in his, and with that touch all
words were made superfluous.


When the contre-danse was over, they
were for a few minutes separated from the
crowd. " Why have you never been near
us ?" inquired Vevette in a low tone.
\"Have you forgotten us ?"


\"Forgotten you, Vevette ! " The way
in which the words were uttered forced her
to look at Eaoul, and when their eyes had
<!-- Leaf 126, Page: 112 -->
met she had no further need to be
reassured.


\"Then, Eaoul," she added, taking
courage, "what is the reason you keep away?
AVhat has happened?"


\"Oh, Yevette," he rejoined, with an
accent of what seen^ed almost like despair,
\"so much has happened. Little enough,
perhaps, for others, but for me everything;"
and then he paused, while she looked and
listened in breathless anxiety. " Suppose,"
he continued, "that all my hopes were at
an end; that I could never look forward
to our marriage. What would remain to
me if I consented to live on, but to
go away as far as I possibly could;—to
put the seas between us ? If all possible
idea of your one day being mine had to be
given up, my duty, however hard, would be
<!-- Leaf 127, Page: 113 -->
to avoid you, and my last chance wrould
be to fly to the end of the world—to New
Zealand or Australia."


\"No, Eaoul, not that," was the rejoinder,
but given in a voice he had never heard
come from those lips before.  
  
  
  " Alas ! and why not ?" he askedmournfully.


\"Because I should die if you did."
They looked for a second steadfastly at
each other; but the Vevette who stood
before Eaoul now he had never known. All
colour had flowm from her lips and cheek,
and the flame in her eyes had darkened,
as it were; the truth had compelled her;
the shy convent-bred girl was gone; and in
her place was the passionate wroman, really
loving unto death.  
  
  
  It was not in masculine nature not for

<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 114 -->
one instant to be enraptured at the avowal
thus desperately made, and for one instant
Eaoul's whole countenance glowed with
the glory of being loved. " Then, my
own," he resumed fondly, "you must know
what has happened, you must know all;
you alone must, decide what shall be our
future. Come what will, in three days I
must be in Paris, but "  
  
  
  "In Paris, in three days ? " gasped Yevette.


\"That must be, darling," he replied
soothingly; "but that is a minor evil. I
will tell you the cause of all my misery,
and I swear to abide by your decision.
Don't look so terrified, love; listen to me;
I have " But all further conversation
was cut short by Monsieur le Maire, who
strutted up to solicit the honour of
Mademoiselle Yevette's hand.
<!-- Leaf 129, Page: 115 -->

When the quadrille was over, the eternal
topic of old Prosper Morel was recurred
to, for the benefit of a visitor at a
neighbouring chateau to whom the entire story
was new. " Do you know, Monsieur le
Vicomte," urged Monsieur le Maire,
harking back to his old argument of "public
justice,"—" Do you know that what Joseph
le Vaillant tells is passing strange all the
same ? "


\"Oh! so you've been inspecting poor old
Prosper, have you ?" asked Monsieur de
Verancour, with a supercilious glance at the
Juge de Paix's son.


\"I went up there yesterday," replied the
lanky youth.


\"Well, and what did you see that was so
wonderful ? "  
  
  
  " Oh, only Prosper's drawings, and the
<!-- Leaf 130, Page: 116 -->
same words over and over. ' Prosper did
it,' and then the date, ' 14th of October.'
His new mania is to draw a kind of figure of
a guillotine with three great capital letters
under it, a P, an M, and an E. Always
these three same; and sometimes they stand
under a guillotine, sometimes flames are
pictured under them : but always these three
letters are repeated; and over the
guillotine he mostly writes, ' Expiation !' And
then he sits down before the drawing and
looks at it till your flesh creeps as you look
at him. Is not that a queer thing, Monsieur
le Vicomte ? "


\"An M, that's Morel," said Monsieur de
Verancour, "and P, that's Prosper; but
what's E for ? "


\"Well, perhaps Betribution ! " opined
the Juge de Paix.
<!-- Leaf 131, Page: 117 -->

\"I will go up in a day or two and see
to all this myself," said Monsieur le Maire.
\"I can't go to-morrow, but I will positively
go the day after."  
  
  
  The Vicomte shrugged his shoulders.


\"Poor devil! " said he, " they'll torture
him to death."


\"I incline to think the Maire is quite
right," observed the Cure gravely. " I
can't help believing there is more in all
this than you fancy."

  prosper's arrest.

Upon the face of it, was there enough to
account for Eaoul de Morville's sore
depression of spirits ? That question touches
the individual appreciation of suffering,
which is different in each human being.
AVhat to one is but a feather, may to
another be a weight beneath which he is
crushed. If young Morville's past life,
and the hopes upon which his whole heart
had centred, be taken into consideration, it
<!-- Leaf 133, Page: 119 -->
is certain that he had good cause to feel
exceedingly unhappy.


If the circumstances wherewith love is
surrounded in different countries be well
examined, it will be seen that nothing can
be more various than the aspects of the
passion which many people falsely believe
to be the same everywhere.


If a man without fortune love a girl
without a farthing, in England, need he despair ?
No ! for he has resources open to him : he
can work and win her, he can emigrate
to one of the many lands where English
is spoken, and by dint of toil, time, and
endurance, it is more than probable he may
end by gaining enough to enable him to
unite himself to her without whom life
seems to him worthless. At all events
he has society and public opinion on his
<!-- Leaf 134, Page: 120 -->
side. For his energy and for her constancy
everybody will think higher of the couple
who wish to marry for love.


But not so in France. In the first place,
the man who, without money, wishes to
gain it in order to marry the woman he
has chosen, has a marvellously small choice
of means whereby to achieve his aim. If
he has financial aptitudes, no scruples, and
great luck, he may by some stroke on the
bourse, in which he has risked honour,—
in case of failure,—achieve fortune; but
the man capable of that is mostly a man
incapable of the devotion we suppose him
setting out to serve. For a chivalrous
minded man,—and the man who resolves
to win the girl he loves is that,—it is hard
to see any resource in France. How he
is to achieve independence in a country
<!-- Leaf 135, Page: 121 -->
where every single field for activity, large
or small, is railed in and set aside, and
where nothing is open to individual energy,
it is hard to see; but what is worse is,
that he has society, and the opinion of all
the men and women in it, against him. He
must do whatever he does without ever
allowing his motive to be guessed, or he
is lost. His friends would set him down
for a fool, and the rest of the world for
something near akin to a perturbator of
general morality.


All that esteem, all that sympathetic
encouragement which are so necessary to
the man who has to fight a hard fight, are
denied in France to the man who dreams
of marrying for love. He becomes a species
of pariah, whom it is unsafe to let inside
your doors. If he, being without money,
<!-- Leaf 136, Page: 122 -->
chose to love a girl who has plenty, that
is quite another thing. If he wins her,
he will be applauded because the love can
be denied. If a very rich man, on the
other hand, be resolved to marry a woman
who is poor, that again will be tolerated;—
though not viewed so favourably as the
preceding case, because it gives doubly a
bad example : first, to rich sons of families
who, independently of their parents, may
take to marrying penniless wives; and next,
to dowerless girls, who may nourish
illusions and become dangerous to the peace of
respectable families.


No ! The fitness of things lies in the
union of money with money. That, is
according to rule. What is so also, is the
union of high birth with wealth. In this
arrangement also there is a fitness pleasant
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 123 -->
to contemplate, for there is an exchange
of valuables. Something is sold and
something bought, and it is altogether a
business transaction,—in which a Frenchman
tells you, you find " a guarantee ! "


But in a marriage of poverty with
poverty there is no " guarantee," and the
love which induces it is only an "
aggravating circumstance."


Now, Eaoul's position was in this respect
the worst of all possible positions. He had
conceived the mad idea of winning by his
own exertions the hand of a girl who was as
poor as himself. He had no excuse, for he
had been brought up with Felicie and
Vevette, and knew their pecuniary situation
as well as he knew his own. Of course,
if Mademoiselle Genevieve de Verancour
shared his absurd notions, it was wholly and
<!-- Leaf 138, Page: 124 -->
entirely his fault; for unless he had forced
them upon her, how should a well-born
girl, educated in a convent too ! ever
entertain any idea so utterly wrong as that of
marrying for love ? All the blame would
be Eaoul's; and had he any, the remotest
chance, of earning for himself the even
relative independence that would enable
him to aspire to the hand of his beloved ?


Perhaps there had been a time, not far
off, when he had thought that his hopes
might be realised; but what were his present
prospects? He had twelve hundred francs
a year for working hard in a public office
for eight hours a day ! Forty-eight pounds
per annum would not go far to maintain a
wife, let alone children. And what were
his other chances ? Perhaps promotion in
six or eight years, and a salary of
<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 125 -->
seventyfive, or it might be a hunch-ed pounds
yearly;—for he had no " protection."


All this was disheartening enough, and
Eaoul was disheartened. He loved Vevette
with his whole heart and soul, and could see
nothing in life worth having if she failed
him. But he sickened at the notion of
waiting for long years. He wanted Vevette
to be his now; now, while he and she were
young, and the first bloom was on their
love. More even than the cheerlessness of
his prospects he felt the hardness of being
obliged to hide his one object in life as
though it were a crime. As a man who
lives for a passion unconnected with
ambition or interest, Eaoul was a man out of all
communion with his fellow-countrymen;
and if you examine impartially his position,
his nature, and his probable chances, you
<!-- Leaf 140, Page: 126 -->
will perhaps see that he had some cause
for apparent despair.  
  
  
  In three days he was to leave D

When to return, and with what hopes? As
he thought of this and this only, it is no
wonder that he paid but little attention to
the events which in D were marching
on apace.


The day following the St. Marc, Monsieur
le Maire could not, as he said, go and visit
the old bueheron, but the day after he did
so, and his visit had a remarkable result.
Monsieur le Maire was an early riser, and
the clocks had not yet struck eight wiien he
turned into the narrow path which, through
the brushwood and brambles, led to the spot
where Prosper Morel had erected his present
abode. The dew was still heavy on the
ground, and the damp under foot and over
<!-- Leaf 141, Page: 127 -->
head made the place remarkably cheerless,
apart from the gloom which was cast around
it by its strange occupant.


When Monsieur le Maire reached the spot
on which stood the shed called La Chapelle
a Prosper, there was no sign of any
inhabitant, no trace of the whereabouts of a living
man. The Maire went straight up to
the open side of the shed, and examined
minutely all the ornaments and accessories
of the chapel, and when he had done that,
he, with the inquisitiveness of a civil
functionary which the Cure had not, proceeded
to an investigation of the other part of the
rude dwelling. It had seemingly neither
door nor window, but on raising the clumsy
bit of hurdle-fence with which the opening
was closed, you looked into a sort of den or
hole in which it was clear that the
<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 128 -->
woodcutter slept. In one corner was a heap of
straw, hay, feather, and fern, all mixed up
together, and covered over with a piece of
coarse brown blanket very much torn. It
was more like the lair of a beast than the
resting-place of a man, but it was evidently
the old man's bed.


The Maire indulged in a protracted
examination of the inside of the
establishment, but found nothing to satisfy his
curiosity. Of the occupant there was no
sign. Leaving the apparent bed-chamber
of the bucheron, and closing it up again
with the hurdle, the visitor passed to the
outside of the shed and proceeded to study
the hieroglyphics of the boarding at the
back of it. Yes, truly enough, there they
were;—the figures and images ancl signs of
which so much had been told ! There were
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 129 -->
the guillotines, and flames, and verses from
the Psalms, and over ancl over repeated, the
words: "Prosper did it," ancl "God be
merciful to the murderer!" And there
stood again and again the letters P and M
under the guillotine, over the flames; but
of no other letter was there any trace;
whether the letter E meant Eetribution, as
the Juge de Paix suggested, or not, was all
one; for there was no letter E to be seen
anywhere. To this Monsieur le Maire
attached very little importance. It only
made him form a rather low estimate of the
accuracy of the Juge de Paix's lanky,
overgrown boy, who in that respect simply
shared in the mind of Monsieur le Maire the
disfavour attaching to boys in general, who
were all in his opinion more or less stupid
and inaccurate.  
  
  
  VOL. II. K
<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 130 -->

At last the Maire discovered Prosper
Morel. But what was he doing ?


Turning round the corner behind the part
of the shed devoted to the chapel, the visitor
came upon what looked at first like a heap
of old clothes, but what turned out to be
the Breton cowering down with hands and
knees upon the ground, and apparently
groping for something hidden upon, or
under the earth. At sight of the intruder
Prosper looked up, and turning round
seated himself deliberately with his back
to the shed and his two hands clasped across
his knees. He neither looked angry nor
surprised, but gazed intently at the Maire.


\"You lead a solitary life out here," began
the dignitary.


\"No ! " answered the Breton, " my life is
peopled. I am never alone."
<!-- Leaf 145, Page: 131 -->

"WTio is with you?" asked the Maire,
determined to humour the old man.


\"Who is with me?" he echoed. "The
past, the past! I'm full of the past."


\"Prosper," continued his interlocutor, " 1
have not come here to do you any harm,
but to judge for myself of the strange
reports that you encourage by your own
conduct. Look at me, Prosper Morel, and
try to tell me the real truth. What reason
have you for saying the wild things you
say ? What interest have you in leading
the whole town down there to believe that
you have committed an awful crime ?"
While the Maire was speaking, Prosper's
countenance underwent no change. All its
life was as usual concentrated in the eyes,
and these were fixed upon the speaker as
though they would absorb his every feature.
<!-- Leaf 146, Page: 132 -->
Slowly he rose, and his huge uncouth figure
leaning against the wall, he put forth his
arm and fastened his bony fingers upon the
Maire's wrist.


\"What reason?" he exclaimed; "what
interest ? What; can't you understand it ?
My soul! my soul! I want to save that.
But that is how you are, you bourgeois, all
of you ! You go to church, but you don't
believe; and you don't care for truth, God's
truth, the eternal truth, by which we are
saved or damned. You will take the life of
an innocent creature, because you think he
seems guilty, and you take no trouble to see
whether he is so or not, and when real guilt
—the very truth of crime—is brought
before you, you won't recognise it, because it
is not discovered by the agents of the law.
Oh! Monsieur le Maire, Monsieur le
<!-- Leaf 147, Page: 133 -->
Maire," went on the bucheron with
desperate earnestness", " we have souls; we really
have souls, and we can save them."


\"But, my good man," objected the
other, now seriously inclined to believe in
Prosper's insanity, " do you mean then,
seriously, to declare that you murdered
Martin Prevost ? "


\"This hand did the deed," repUed the
woodcutter, holding up his right hand and
spreading its five fingers out to their utmost
directly in the face of the Maire, who
stepped back a pace or two. " Yes ! "
resumed the Breton, " this hand, but only
this hand; not mind or will; only the
hand ! "


\"And you hope for forgiveness by
accusing yourself?" suggested his visitor.  
  
  
  " Hope ! I am sure of it. I have
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 134 -->
confessed. I confess every day. Come with
me!" and before he could resist it, the
Maire found himself dragged before the
boarding, on which Prosper pointed out to
him his gloomy writings. " There," he
said, " and there, and there! I hide
nothing, I give all I have to purchase back
my soul, and when the Lord has forgiven
me, expiation will come. I wait, I wait!
De profundis clamavi ad te, Domine!"
And he crossed his hands on his breast and
looked upwards fervently.


The Maire was now all but fully
convinced of Prosper's insanity; and the latter
caught at his conviction by some intuitive
sense. " Ab ! " he exclaimed, with sudden
animation; "that is so like you all. You
don't believe what you don't know. Take
care, Monsieur le Maire; take care ! You
<!-- Leaf 149, Page: 135 -->
don't believe a man has a soul; you don't
believe he ought to give his life to save
it. You wouldn't save yours with your life,
Monsieur le Maire. Saint Thomas ! Saint
Thomas ! they must touch, ere they believe.
Well then, look here ! "


Seizing hold of the Maire's arm he led
him back to the spot where he had himself
been discovered cowering down upon the
ground. He went down upon both knees,
displaced a few loose stones, took up with
his nails a square sod of turf, cleared away
some mould, and brought to view a small
wooden box, the lid of which he opened
without taking the box from its
restingplace. " There," he cried, " what do you
see now ?—golden Napoleons, and
banknotes, and papers, and a purse! There is
all that was taken out of Monsieur's strong
<!-- Leaf 150, Page: 136 -->
box when he was dead. There it lies;—all
that you never could find; all that for
which you were so certain he was killed,
there it lies ! Now you believe because
now you understand. Oh! you wise, wise
men ! And you take to yourselves the right
to punish and absolve ! Help me to save
my soul, Monsieur le Maire, help me to
save my soul! For now you know I am
the murderer of my master."  
  
  
  The Maire was convinced.


That same clay, the 27th of April, Prosper
Morel was arrested by the brigadier de
gendarmerie and his assistants in virtue of
a proper warrant, and lodged provisionally
in the gaol at D He offered no
resistance. On the contrary, a curious kind of
elation seemed to inspire him, and he
<!-- Leaf 151, Page: 137 -->
  
  walked with a firm step between his
captors, into the town of D, a crucifix
clasped with both hands upon his breast,
and chanting as he went, in a loud voice, the
Litanies for the Dead.
<!-- Leaf 152 -->
  
  CHAPTEE XX.  
  
  
  THE DOUBLE ARREST.

Whatever might have been the effect
created at the time by old Martin Prevost's
death, it was immeasurably surpassed by
that which the arrest of the bueheron
produced. There was no end now to the
conjectures and speculations; no saying what
might not be revealed; no limit to the
excitement of the townspeople of D


It was scarcely past noon when the
Breton was brought a prisoner into the
town, and before supper-time every man and
<!-- Leaf 153, Page: 139 -->
woman knew of every detail connected with
his arrest, — or at all events talked as
if they were thoroughly conversant with
them. So great was the agitation of the
little place, and so delighted was the little
population at having such an occurrence
wherewith to occupy itself, that
long-standing feuds were healed in the common
emotion, that Madame Josephine le Yaillant
condescended to exchange ideas with
Madame Valentin, and that Celeste from the
Chateau, and Madelon from the Mairie,
fraternised with Madame Jean;—or rather
tried to do so, for that important personage
felt her importance doubled, and was less
accessible than usual. Madame Jean's
importance was doubled, for she held to the
mystery by both ends. She was in a manner
a co-proprietress of the criminal,—if
<!-- Leaf 154, Page: 140 -->
criminal he was, of which there was no
inconsiderable doubt;—while over the executive
authority as represented in the person of la
gendarmerie itself, who would gainsay her
sovereign influence ?


There was a conviction in the public mind
that Madame Jean really did know
everything, and accordingly Madame Jean was
paid court to instantly, as those are who
have suddenly been invested with some
unusual distinction or power. Besides,
Monsieur le Maire was observed to go three
times in the course of that eventful day to
la Maison Prevost, and at his last visit,
which was late in the day, he was
accompanied by the brigadier.


But the pubbc mind of D had had
time, even in the space of a few hours, to
become divided upon the question of Prosper
<!-- Leaf 155, Page: 141 -->
Morel's insanity. That Prosper had had to
do with the murder of Martin Prevost could
no longer be a matter of doubt; but that he
was the actual murderer, and, above all,
that he was the only one who had
committed the crime,—this became quickly the
cause of the liveliest disputes. Indeed, this
it was which made up the quarrel between
the rich grocer's widow and Madame
Josephine le Vaillant, who both happened to be
of the same opinion. These ladies opined
that some person or persons yet
undiscovered had really done the deed, and had,
for some reason which would later be found
out, been obliged to make an accomplice of
old Prosper, whose weak intellect had been
fairly upset by the horrible drama in which
he had been mixed up. The doctor at
D was of their way of thinking also,
<!-- Leaf 156, Page: 142 -->
for after having spent an hour with the
Breton on the day of his committal to gaol,
he confided to the Juge de Paix that,
according to his belief, the old man was not
altogether of sound mind. " There is an
evident mixture of fact and imagination in
all he says," had been the doctor's remark.
"Up to a certain point he is as clear and
precise as possible, and unmistakably sane;
but past that point, he as unmistakably
wanders, and either he is ignorant or he
won't tell what he knows. I incline to
believe him ignorant."


However, Dr. Javal had been telegraphed
to from Cholet, and it remained to be
seen what that irreverential young
practitioner's opinion would be. Meanwhile,
an immense deal had already come out, and
the craving public mind had devoured one
<!-- Leaf 157, Page: 143 -->
or two hard facts,—facts not to be
controverted.


For instance, in the box dug up under
Prosper's own directions were found a pair
of new shoes, of a small size for a man, but
answering to the impression left upon the
minds of all who had assisted at the original
\"instruction " in October, by the foot-marks
traced in the garden. Of course, in so
grave a matter a mere impression left upon
men's memories was scarcely a thing to rest
an inference upon. Still, there were the
shoes, too small for any one connected with
the Prevost household; and they bore
marks of having probably been worn but
once. The heels were scarcely soiled, whilst
the fore part of the sole was still clogged
with a crust of dry mud out of which a few
blades of dry grass were extracted.
<!-- Leaf 158, Page: 144 -->

Now, as to the money ! There was found,
in five small parcels,—twro only in rouleaux,
—the sum of 5,000 francs in gold;
corresponding to what Monsieur Eichard had
found noted down on a paper in bis uncle's
strong box. In a small leathern
pocketbook, or portfolio, were also found a number
of bank-notes wrapped up in a piece of
paper. But on this paper were written the
following figures:—  
  
  
  " 20 100 fc. notes.

12 500 do.  
  
  
  2 1000 do.  
  
  
  Total, 10,000 ses."

Now, when the notes were counted up they
made a total of only 8,000, instead of 10,000.
The two of 1,000 francs each were missing.


It became therefore evident that whoever
the criminals really were, they had robbed
<!-- Leaf 159, Page: 145 -->
their victim to a certain extent, though
undoubtedly an insignificant one, considering
the far larger sum they had had at their
disposal, and had left untouched. Having
taken this much, why had they taken no
more ? If dishonest at all, why so
moderate?


When the fact, however, of the missing
notes was brought home to Prosper, the old
man's demeanour changed altogether.
Instead of the strange half-dreamy,
halfecstatic manner he had assumed from the
first, he grew vehement, and all but furious.
At the bare suspicion that he had robbed
the murdered man, his indignation burst
violently forth, and he stalked up and down
the room where he had been brought for the
first preliminary examination, alternately
uttering incoherent phrases of bitter anger,  
  
  
  VOL. II. L
<!-- Leaf 160, Page: 146 -->
or relapsing into a dogged silence, during
which he contented himself with glowering
at the mayor, and gnashing his teeth.


\"One thing is easy to see," whispered
the brigadier, who was present,—apparently
for the protection of Monsieur le Maire,—
\"and that is, that if he were enraged, there's
nothing he would stop at."


But the Breton was unmanageable, and
sullenly retreating into a corner, declared
he would not open his mouth again till the
Cure, who had been sent for at his desire,
should have arrived. When the Cure did
come, the old man rose, shoved aside the
gendarme with one sweep of his long lean
arm, and, walking straight up to the priest,
went down on both knees before him, and
said, in a tone at once earnest and
submissive :
<!-- Leaf 161, Page: 147 -->

\"I have confessed, father! I have
confessed ! I have lightened my soul of its
load; I have done what you ordered me to
do; but tell me I can save my soul; tell
me the punishment will not be eternal; tell
me I shall be forgiven; tell me that, mon
pere; tell me that! "


"My poor friend!" said the Cure, with
the utmost compassion in his tone, and
laying his hand upon the bucheron's head;
\"so surely as you confess your
transgressions, and repent of them with all your
heart, so surely will you be forgiven.
God's mercy is infinite; but you must
confess all your sins;—you must withhold
nothing."


\"I have told all! " exclaimed the Breton,
suddenly springing to his feet, and with a
glance of rekindling indignation; " but am
<!-- Leaf 162, Page: 148 -->
I not to tell the crimes of others, too ? Are
others to go unpunished?"


The manner of the man while saying this
was so singular, there was such a revengeful
air about him, that, coupled with the very
unsafe condition of his intellect, the Cure
thought he foresaw a danger, and
determined to guard against it as best he could.
"Prosper Morel," said he sternly, "the
confession of your misdeeds is what will
save your soul. The misdeeds of others lie
between God and them. Beware of the
spirit of revenge, my son! it will stand
between you and atonement even to the
Day of Judgment. You will expiate
nothing by confessing other people's sins.
You must repent of your own."


The brigadier fairly shrugged his shoulders
with impatience on hearing this, and clanked
<!-- Leaf 163, Page: 149 -->
his big sabre on the ground; and the Maire
came up to the Cure cautiously, and
putting his mouth close to the latter's ear, he
whispered, " But if we could get him to
reveal; if we could get him to put us on
the trace of "


The priest, who was a powerful man,
literally whisked the Maire, who wras a
small, pudgy one, into the embrasure of the
window; and, standing with his back turned
to Prosper, so that the arrested man should
not overhear him, he said, quite lowly,
"The man is not safe; once set him on
revealing, and God only knows what he
will imagine! He is as likely as not to
' reveal' you as his accomplice."—The Maire
started back with horror.—" Yes ! every
bit as likely as not. The man is not
altogether sane, though he will probably tell
<!-- Leaf 164, Page: 150 -->
the entire truth about himself; but don't
trust him with the lives and reputations of
others. There is no saying to whom he
owes a grudge, or what mischief might
be done. Keep him to what touches himself
only."


The civil functionary obeyed, though
reluctantly, for he did not relish being baulked
of a revelation or two.


\"Now, Prosper," recommenced the Cure,
\"tell the truth about these missing notes.
Calm yourself; subdue your anger; and
now tell us how comes it that these two
1000-franc notes are gone ? "


\"I will only speak if my words are
credited," rejoined the Breton, sullenly.


\"Speak to me, Prosper, and I will
believe you," continued the Cure.  
  
  
  "Well, then, mon pere, by my hopes of
<!-- Leaf 165, Page: 151 -->
salvation, I know nothing of the money in
the box. I saw it put in,—the gold and
the leathern portfolio,—but as it was when
put in, so it has remained ever since."


\"But," objected the Cure, " you see
these notes were wrapped up in a sheet of
paper that was sealed, and the seal has been
broken. You see these figures, written on
the paper; they mark the sum of 10,000
francs, and specify two 1000-franc notes.
These are gone."


\"Monsieur le Cure," answered Prosper,
\"if my own soul had not been sleepless
within me and tortured me, needed I to
proclaim my guilt ? Was not my innocence
accredited ? Have I not come freely,
joyfully, into the enemy's toils ? Have I not
come here to pay for the salvation of my
immortal soul with my mortal body ? This
<!-- Leaf 166, Page: 152 -->
hand,—this hand "—and he held his hand
aloft—" committed a murder; but of any
theft I know nothing. That box has never
been touched since I carried it away after
the murder, till this morning when I showed
it to Monsieur le Maire."


The Cure looked steadfastly at the
prisoner, who never quailed before his
gaze.


\"Mon pere," at last added Prosper,
\"you must believe what I say, for you
believe in what the Gospel teaches; you
know that we have souls, and that we can
save them;—they don't!" and he waved
his arm over all the other spectators of
the scene. " They believe not. Mon
pere, tell them I speak the truth, for I
am trying hard to save my soul."  
  
  
  The Cure turned to the Maire, and with
<!-- Leaf 167, Page: 153 -->
great gravity said, " I do believe the man
speaks the truth."


"But, then, the notes?" retorted the
irritated Maire; " and the broken seal ?"


"Time and the progress of the
'instruction ' will throw light upon the whole,"
rejoined the Cure; "but I must believe
Prosper Morel's words, and I do so."


At all events, nothing more was to be
made of the Breton; and before the day
closed a new and quite unforeseen direction
was given to the current of the public
thought in D Eaoul de Morville was
arrested for having been implicated in the
murder of Martin Prevost, just as he was
stepping into the diligence which was to
convey him to the railway station, where
he was to take the night train to Paris.
<!-- Leaf 168 -->
  
  CHAPTEE XXI.  
  
  
  YEVETTE'S SORROW.

Of the sensation called forth by this last
event it is scarcely necessary to speak.
Nothing so extraordinary had ever
happened in D, not only "within the
memory of man," but even,—as Monsieur
le Maire proclaimed, — "in the annals of
history." A young man of good birth,—
a handsome, clever, gay,
hunting-and-shooting gentilhomme, — was accused of the
murder of a snuffy old bourgeois, of a
hard-fisted old usurer, who was as much
<!-- Leaf 169, Page: 155 -->
disliked as he who was accused of
murdering him was popular! True, the strange
alteration in Eaoul's manner, so generally
commented upon, was immediately referred
to; but, as compared with the enormity
of the crime, all this sank into nothing;
and the past of the fine, generous young
fellow, who, without having had a
"chance" in life, had "got on" all by
himself, mastered a good, sound
education, and never deserved an enemy, rose
up now in the minds of his townsmen,
and protested against the awful accusation
under which he laboured.


From the moment when young Morville
was arrested less was known of what took
place than had been hitherto the case, and
the public mind seemed in a fair way to
be tortured by the efforts made to preserve
<!-- Leaf 170, Page: 156 -->
secrecy. This much was known, that,
between the hour of his arrest and
midnight, two telegrams had been exchanged
between D and the chief town of the
department, which was rather more than
eight English miles distant; and D,
as we know, not having a telegraph station,
on each occasion a man on horseback had
to be sent off,—which produced a great
impression.


The day following Eaoul's arrest more
telegraphic messages were despatched to
and fro, and it was even rumoured that
Monsieur le Sous-Preset might be expected
in the course of the day.


Do what the authorities would,—and
they did do their utmost,—some few
scraps of information did ooze out; and
it remained an averred fact that the
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 157 -->
brigadier had stayed more than an hour in
La Maison Prevost! Nay, that he had
actually breakfasted with Madame Jean
in her kitchen,—it was her second
breakfast,—and that she had brought from the
cellar, and devoted to the especial usage
of Monsieur Fredeii, a bottle of some old
Burgundy by which her defunct master
set extraordinary store. How did this get
known? Well, there are assuredly genii
who preside over the longings of human
curiosity; and in this case the particular
genius was supposed to be Nicholas, the
\"out-door man," who had seen the wine
brought up from the cellar, and not got
one drop of it to drink.


Disjointed, garbled evidences, therefore,
did, as I have said, leak out, and the
public ended by obtaining some few scraps
<!-- Leaf 172, Page: 158 -->
wherewith to still its hunger; for Madame
Jean, though a very inaccessible woman,
was mortal, after all, and could not wholly
withstand the amount of flattery with
which she was assailed that day. Why,
she received in her kitchen the visit
conjointly of those two leading persons,
Madame Valentin and Madame Josephine
le Vaillant, who, in chorus, styled her
their dear Madame Jean, and promised
her, the one, some liqueur des iles, sweet
enough to ruin all her teeth, the other,
some very curious snuff, against neither of
which seductions was that stern female
proof.


By the time, then, that noon had been
rung out from the church steeple of D,
several small facts had crept forth, been
eagerly pounced upon, and, naturally
<!-- Leaf 173, Page: 159 -->
enough, distorted. It seemed clearly
ascertained that with the robbery Eaoul
would be proved to have nothing to do;
and that, of course, obtained credence at
once. But, on the other hand, a frightful
proof of his guilt was whispered about.
It was stated that the shoes found in the
wooden box with the money, and so much
too small for any of the feet on which they
had till now been tried, fitted young De
Morville perfectly! It was asserted that,
with the exception of trying on the shoes,
—which was an invention of the Maire's,—
Eaoul had, as yet, not been subjected to
any investigation; that he was kept very
privately, and was not to be examined till
precise instructions came from the
cheflieu.  
  
  
  Touching the woodcutter, somewhat more
<!-- Leaf 174, Page: 160 -->
was known, and he was reported to have
made some very strange depositions.. He was
said to have declared that the whole night
preceding the murder had been spent by him
inside old Prevost's house !—a fact which,
as Madame Jean remarked, " would have
made your blood run cold, if it was not such
a palpable impossibility." And here, again,
opinion was obliged to incHne towards the
conviction of Prosper's partial insanity.
Then, again, when simply questioned as
to what was his acquaintance with Eaoul de
Morville, he merely stared, hastily said he
was the best shot in the country, and
refused any further answer. In reality the
Breton appeared with each passing hour, to
be narrowing his attention more and more
to one single point, namely, to his own
personal guilt, and to the certainty of achieving
<!-- Leaf 175, Page: 161 -->
forgiveness by expiation. He was more
mystical than ever, and had passed the night
in praying, singing the " De Profundis,"
and covering the walls of his cell with his
favourite writings and images, produced by
means of a bit of charcoal, which the gaoler
saw no harm in letting him have. All his
ideas ran the same way. " Expiation ! "
was the word for ever on his lips, and he
paced up ancl down his prison, or squatted
on the floor, a crucifix in his hands, and
muttering : " The sacrifice of blood ! " or,
\"The price ! the price ! 0 Lord ! the full
price ! " or, "As I sinned, so I pay! "
When not thus occupied, he was stubbornly
silent and sullen, refusing to exchange a
syllable with the gardien whom it had been
deemed advisable to place with him in his

cell.  
  
  
  VOL. II.  
  
  
  >I
<!-- Leaf 176, Page: 162 -->

"Why am I to be tormented ? " he had
once said. " I have owned my crime; they
know it up there. AVhat more is required ?
AVhy not give me my chance quickly ? I
have purchased my salvation; why do they
shut the gates through which I am to go to
it ? " This very fixity of ideas on the part
of the bucheron threatened to make the case
a vastly complicated one.


\"It will be extremely hard for justice to
see the way out," observed the doctor, " for
the longer the whole lasts, the more rooted
become the convictions,—or delusions,—of
that wretched old man, and the more difficult
it will be to discover what is fact and
what hallucination. He gets madder with
every half-hour of solitude, and we shall
end by, in reality, possessing only two
positive certainties,—one, that Martin
<!-- Leaf 177, Page: 163 -->
Prevost was murdered, and the other, that
Morel had something to do with it. But
what then ? I doubt our ever getting very
far beyond that."


Somewhat later in the day Monsieur le
Cure's Lise made her appearance in her
master's study, and announced to him that
la demoiselle Vevette wished to speak to
him. The Cure was walking backwards and
forwards in evident perturbation of spirit
when this took place, and he at first looked
rather vacantly at Lise, who repeated her
message. Before he had found time to
express his readiness to receive her, Yevette
was standing at the room-door, and one
moment after they were together alone.


The girl came forward with both her
hands stretched out, which the Cure took in
both his, and then he looked at her. She
<!-- Leaf 178, Page: 164 -->
was making strong efforts to speak, and her
lips quivered and twitched, and she gasped,
whilst the contraction in her throat
prevented all distinct utterance. " My child ! "
said the priest, tenderly. Again she tried to
speak, but in vain; and clutching his fingers
in a tighter grasp, she sank upon her knees;
and, resting her head upon the Cure's hands,
burst into a fit of violent, irrepressible
sobbing.


He raised her up, placed her in a chair,
laid his hand gently and reverently upon
her head, and seating himself near her, left
her to compose herself, without attempting
to comfort her by useless phrases.


When the first paroxysm of grief was a
little abated he spoke to her. " You have
done well, my poor little one, to come to me
at once," he said; " for if consolation, and
<!-- Leaf 179, Page: 165 -->
hope, are to be had anywhere, it is here.
You know that there is no limit to my
devotion to you; you know that I promised
your mother on her death-bed, that I would
always watch over you."


Vevette pressed her handkerchief to her
eyes; and, after a last struggle, looked up,
and, though still with difficulty, she spoke:
"Father," said she, and though the voice
shook, the expression of the face was
strangely resolute, "whatever comes, I
will be Eaoul's wife. Help us, or I shall
die!" and she clung to the sleeve of his
soutane.


\"I will help you," replied the priest
impressively, but without manifesting the
slightest surprise; " but, my dearest child,
will you help me to help you both ? Will
you do your best ? Will you, for his sake,
<!-- Leaf 180, Page: 166 -->
be calm,—that is, try to be so,—and will
you really follow the instructions I may
give you ? "


\"I will," answered Vevette, never taking
her eyes off his face, or her fingers off his
sleeve.


\"Well, then; let us try to put some
order in our thoughts and in our
proceedings. Tell me, does any one in your own
family guess at what you have just told
me?"  
  
  
  "No one."


\"I confess," continued the priest, "I
have never had the remotest suspicion of
all this; though, perhaps, to a man of the
world, it might have appeared inevitable.
How long have you been engaged to
Eaoul ? "  
  
  
  " I don't know, mon pere," answered she
<!-- Leaf 181, Page: 167 -->
simply, "but I think always. You know
we were children together, till Felicie and I
went to the Visitation; and when we came
back home, it was always the same; ancl I
never coidd marry any one but Eaoul."


The Cure sat for a moment silently, with
compressed lips and knitted brow.


\"Of course," he then said, " you are
convinced of Eaoul's innocence ? "


Her eyes flashed fire, and her cheeks
burnt as she cried, "As convinced as I am
of my own existence ! As convinced as
you are too ! " she added triumphantly.


The Cure looked at her and leaned back
in his chair. "Yes, Vevette," he rejoined,
\"I am morally convinced that Monsieur de
Morville had no hand whatever in the
murder, but that is not all. Innocence is
not sufficient always, and we must guard
<!-- Leaf 182, Page: 168 -->
against complications. There are some very
strange facts in this case, and the more we
believe in our friend's guiltlessness, the
better we must be prepared to meet them.
One thing would be, in any other case,
immensely in his favour, and that is, that
Prosper Morel denies his complicity
altogether."


"Well, then," exclaimed Vevette
joyfully, " what more can be required ? "


\"A great deal more, I fear, for you see
Prosper is himself a most unsafe witness.
It is a very delicate matter to deal with a
man who is more than half mad; facts have
to be weighed."


\"But no fact can possibly criminate
Eaoul," cried Yevette impatiently.


\"In your mind and mine, no ! But we
are not magistrates, and I fear that Eichard
<!-- Leaf 183, Page: 169 -->
Prevost has been forced to make a
deposition that implicates "


\"Eichard Prevost!" interrupted she
indignantly, and springing to her feet,
\"Eichard Prevost! that wretched, vile,
cowardly creature ! Oh ! how I always
hated and despised him ! What has he
dared to say ? "


\"Vevette !" said the Cure, rising also,
and confronting the girl, whose usually
gentle aspect was literally transfigured with
rage and contempt, " Vevette, calm
yourself and attend to me. I was never a
particular friend of Eichard Prevost's. His
nature has nothing in it sympathetic for me.
I have always regarded him as a selfish,
weak, purse-proud man; but I am obliged
to say that in this case he has behaved well,  
  
  
  -very well. You must believe me.
<!-- Leaf 184, Page: 170 -->
Monsiem- Prevost has not only behaved well;
he has behaved with delicacy and kindness,
and shown the utmost repugnance to bear
any testimony against any one; but, as in
nearly all such cases, there are facts which
are embarrassing, and "


\"Oh ! forgive me, mon pere ! forgive
me!" entreated Vevette, the tears
streaming afresh down her checks. " I will speak
ill of no one, I promise you; but it is so
hard to bear;—and all the harder that I
know my own sin in loving Eaoul as I do;
loving him better than everything ! " and
she wrung her hands in despair.


\"What is this? " asked the Cure, seizing
her hands in his, and not sorry to divert her
thoughts into a new channel; " what is this
nonsense, Vevette ? You mean to be Eaoul's
wife, do you not, if it pleases God to bring
<!-- Leaf 185, Page: 171 -->
him safe out of all these troubles ? And as
I know you, I know beyond all doubt that
you will at all times be worthy to be his
wife,—be pure and spotless as snow." He
looked hard at her, ancl spoke slowly.


And she, with a deep blush, whispered
"Yes, I will."


\"Well, then," he resumed, with what
was almost an accent of irritation, " what is
all this absurdity,—all this exaggeration ?
We have trials and troubles enough before
us; don't let us increase them by our own
voluntary act. Let us try to act and think
uprightly, honestly, and not get entangled
in any of the villainously crooked ways of
over-scrupulousness. Beware of that,
Vevette. It all comes from the false teachings
of the convent. I know it well; it's not
the first time I've had to deal with it."
<!-- Leaf 186, Page: 172 -->

"Monsieur le Cure," interrupted
Vevette; "it is all too late now. I cannot
repent, but I know my sin. I know I am
risking my salvation in loving him as I do,
but I will risk it. I will risk life and soul
for him now."


\"You will do no such thing," interrupted
the priest, in an extremely stern tone. "You
shall learn to distinguish between real right
and real wrong, my poor child, or I will
not help you. I will have no false morality;
above all, no false purity,—which is of all
things the most impure. You shall see the
truth and worship it. You shall love God
and fear Him, and bear whatever He gives
you to bear,—mark you, whatever it may
be. But when once you are the wife of the
man you have chosen, you shall love him
with all your heart, wholly and entirely,
<!-- Leaf 187, Page: 173 -->
and so that you shall love nothing else in
the whole world half as much. And you
shall do this because this is Christian law,
the law of God, whatever all the Jesuits and
all the nuns in all the convents in
Christendom may tell you to the contrary. And
now, my poor dear child, go home, try to be
calm, lift your whole heart up to God, and
rely upon me utterly."


Strengthened, though somewhat abashed,
by the Cure's resolute ways, Vevette
prepared to obey. AVhen she had reached the
door, "Mon pere," inquired she, " may I
not know what it is Monsieur Eichard had
to say ? You see I am quiet now; and I will
never speak ill of Monsieur Eichard again."


The Cure reflected, and answered at last:
\"Perhaps I ought to refuse, but it would be
worse if you heard what has happened from
<!-- Leaf 188, Page: 174 -->
any one else. Promise me to be courageous,
and to trust in Providence for help.
Monsieur Eichard has been obliged to produce
a letter which he found after his uncle's
death, in which Eaoul asks old Prevost for
two thousand francs, and says that if he
does not obtain them within a week, life is
worthless to him. The letter is dated just
a week before the murder."


\"Eaoul never wrote it," exclaimed
Vevette.


"Eaoul did write it, my child," retorted
the Cure, "for I have had the letter in my
hands, and read it."  
  
  
  " Has Eaoul seen it ? " she asked wildly.


\"Not yet, it has not been shown to him
yet; they are waiting for further
instructions from the chef-lieu." And then,
seeing that Vevette was almost fainting
<!-- Leaf 189, Page: 175 -->
from the effects of this last piece of news,
\"My child," he added gravely ancl tenderly,
\"the discovery of this letter does not destroy
my moral conviction in Eaoul's innocence.
It must not injure yours. Go, ancl trust
in God, and at all moments rely upon my
devotion."


And she went, mournfully, but
determined to do her best.
<!-- Leaf 190 -->
  
  CHAPTEE XXII.  
  
  
  THE JUGE D'lNSTRUCTION.

As the doctor had predicted, the
complications of the case became more embarrassing
with every hour, and when the
"authorities " had arrived at D——,—which they
did the third day after Eaoul's arrest,—
and an "instruction" had for the second
time been set on foot touching the murder
of Martin Prevost, the proceedings were
quickly involved in such intricacy of detail,
that the wisest of the magistrates declared
there was no means of seeing clear in the
<!-- Leaf 191, Page: 177 -->
matter. This being so, and the natural
tendency of all French lawyers being granted,
of course the current of professional opinion
set in dead against the prisoners, and more,
even, against Monsieur de Morville than
against Prosper.


Everything combined to make Eaoul the
more interesting culprit of the two; and
the singularly sharp, inhuman propensities
which invariably develop themselves in a
Frenchman the moment he has to do with
the workings of criminal law, gave
themselves full swing directly there was a
probability of a condemnation in the upper ranks
of society.


No one who does not live in French
society,—who is not " of it,"—will ever
attain to a thorough knowledge of the
inordinate measure of that society'sconVOL. II. n
<!-- Leaf 192, Page: 178 -->
servatism. There is scarcely anything in
the way of injustice or cruelty at which
the individual in France will stop if you
appeal to him in the name of " society," and
remind him of his protective duties as a
member of it.


And the origin of all this ferocity,—as it
is of nearly all cruelty,—is simply fear.
To be governed, defended, and if needed,
avenged! to be in every possible and
imaginable way "taken care of," is the
eternal ideal of a Frenchman ! And the
most perfect lamb of a cotton night-cap
maker, whose wife leads him the life of a
dog, will turn into a very hyæna if you put
into his hands the fate of one of his
fellowcreatures suspected of crime against purse or
person. There are no merciful jurors in
France, as there are few,—if any,—perfectly
<!-- Leaf 193, Page: 179 -->
just judges. Bring a human being before
them as an "accuse," and bench, bar, and
jury are all predisposed to believe him
guilty, are all more or less desirous that he
should be proved so. In the case of a juror,
the one guiding sentiment is, " This might
have happened to me !" In the case of the
magistracy, the ardour of pursuit is
inflamed to a degree incredible to those who
have not seen it with their own eyes.


The innocence of a mere human being, a
unit in the social sum total, is of
comparatively no consequence. Think of poor, dear,
unoffending, unprotected " society,"—that
is, you and me, and " everybody " generally,
—if one of these horrible beasts of prey gets
loose !


Now all this amount of cruelty ancl
cowardice, animating every single
<!-- Leaf 194, Page: 180 -->
functionary, from the Juge d'Instruction down to
the Garde Champetre, took Eaoul de Morville
for its butt. In the first place, he was in
reality more interesting than the
woodcutter; and in the next, no intense feeling
divides itself. It chooses arbitrarily, and
there, where it has become fixed, it
concentrates all its energy. Eaoul was, therefore,
the pet victim, the favourite of this dreadful
race, and he or she was but ill received who
ventured to hint at the possibility of his
innocence in the presence of any one
belonging to la robe.


The townspeople of D however,
imperfectly informed as they now were,
continued to behave in a not totally
discreditable manner. There were parties for and
against the accused; and, supposing him to
be proved absolutely innocent, free from all
<!-- Leaf 195, Page: 181 -->
possible suspicion,—so perfectly spotless, in
short, as to render his being "let loose"
again manifestly without danger to
themselves,—there were people in D who
would be actually glad of his acquittal;
which was saying a great deal.


The Juge d'Instruction sent down to
investigate the case of the Prevost murder
was a hard, opinionated man, whose zeal was,
on this particular occasion, stimulated by
two different causes,—one, that his colleague
in the original proceedings of seven months
before had evidently made a mess of the
whole business; and the other, that he
himself had been twice unlucky within the last
twelvemonth,—namely, had twice seen
criminals, prejudged and precondemned in his
own mind, escape him. He was determined
this should not be the case now, and that if
<!-- Leaf 196, Page: 182 -->
Eaoul got out of his clutches it should not
be his fault. The natural consequence of all
this was, that the whole course of the
instruction was directed against Monsieur de
Morville, whilst the Breton was treated as
of less importance. Towards Eichard
Prevost the behaviour of the Juge d'Instruction
was almost deferential; he reproached him
with too much leniency only, with a
culpable disregard for the sacred interests of
\"society," in screening, as it must be
admitted he had done, a man so evidently
guilty ! Still, the magistrate was willing to
call this an "amiable weakness,"—so long
as he was not himself expected to exercise
it,—and Monsieur Eichard being the
wealthiest member of the community in
D, came to be truly a "representative
man; " and " society " becoming, therefore,
<!-- Leaf 197, Page: 183 -->
as it were, incarnate in him, the Juge
protected him accordingly. But from first to
last he went his own way, would listen to
no suggestion from any one,—not even from
the Cure. He disliked priests, he said !—and
meant to leave this inquisition of his into
the Prevost murder as a model of sagacity
and penetration to all juges d'instruction to
come.


Eaoul was kept with unmitigated severity
in solitary confinement, it having been
resolved to collect the entire amount of
evidence against him before subjecting him
to the first interrogatory. The letter found
by Eichard Prevost after his uncle's death
was in the hands of the Juge. He
pronounced it, as far as his opinion went,
\"quite conclusive," but reserved it as
the one proof wherewith to crush Eaoul's
<!-- Leaf 198, Page: 184 -->
defence, whenever he attempted to make
any.


Now, what were the results of the
examinations which Prosper Morel had to
undergo ? They were very unsatisfactory,
and extremely hard to get at, for he
sometimes refused doggedly to answer at all;
at others, he insisted upon the presence
of the Cure, which the Juge would not
permit, and perpetually declared that since
he had confessed his crime, that was
enough, ancl that he ought to be allowed
the full and entire benefit of expiation
without delay.


One thing he persisted in from the outset,
namely, that Monsieur de Morville had
absolutely nothing to do with the whole,
that he scarcely knew him, and had, he
believed, never spoken to him in his life.
<!-- Leaf 199, Page: 185 -->
From two or three small facts which came
out, and which we will relate in due time,
this seemingly proved too much.
Consequently it increased suspicion, and made
the bucheron's denials of Eaoul's complicity
unavailing.


As far as Prosper's own statement went,
here was what, with infinite trouble, was
made out:—He had assassinated old
Prevost on the morning of the 14th of October
of the previous year. He had had " words"
with his master some days before, and had,
in fact, been turned out of his service on
account of the complaints made against him
for poaching. Subsequently, his master
consented to keep him,on; but the bucheron
had not forgiven or forgotten the offence,
and had been terrified by the notion of how
insecure his means of livelihood were,
<!-- Leaf 200, Page: 186 -->
exposed as he was at any moment to be turned
adrift, and die of hunger on the roadside.
This had driven him to commit the crime.
This " and the counsels of the Tempter,"
he added. And when he was asked who
the " tempter " was, he invariably replied,
\"The devil in the form of a man ! "


Wbo this " man" was he stubbornly
refused to say, and when driven too far,
would sit down and oppose silence only
to all questions. "Take him back to his
cell and lock him up till he chooses to
speak; I can wait for ever!" was the
Juge's sole resource; but to this the Breton
always yielded;—the notion of perpetual
and solitary confinement, with no "chance
of expiation," as he termed it, being full
of invincible terror to his gloomy,
superstitious nature.
<!-- Leaf 201, Page: 187 -->

The manner in which the crime had been
committed was, according to the account
extracted from the bucheron, as follows :—
The moment Madame Jean and Nicholas
were both gone out, Prosper stole from his
hiding-place,—where that had been he
refused to say,—and crept up-stairs to his
master's room. On looking through the
key-hole he perceived Monsieur Prevost,
already dressed, and standing in front of
his desk, which was open. He knocked at
the door, and when told to come in, began
by asking pardon for coming at such an
early hour,—it was then about half-past
six,—but he said that, being,—as his
master knew,—obliged to go to Jouzy,—
a village some five miles off,—to deliver
some timber, he had thought it well to
come and consult Monsieur touching the
<!-- Leaf 202, Page: 188 -->
arrangement to be made about a certain
quantity of wood to be furnished for sleepers
to the railway administration. He reminded
old Prevost that when at Jouzy he was
not very far from the M station, ancl
that, instead of losing another day, he
might as well settle about the sleepers at
once. He said he was persuaded his victim
would immediately search for the minute
of the agreement made with the railway
people, and that he should then have him
at his mercy. This was precisely what
happened. Martin Prevost bent forwards
and pulled out a drawer in his desk in
which he kept papers of importance; and
while he was in the act of so doing, Prosper
took a deliberate aim from behind with a
hammer which he had concealed under his
blouse, and hit him just above the nape
<!-- Leaf 203, Page: 189 -->
of the neck. Stunned by the blow, old
Prevost fell without uttering even a groan,
only stretching forth his arms. The
murderer avowed that, after his victim had
fallen, he struck him twice or three times
more. He could not tell precisely how
many times, but he said he struck him to
make sure he was dead.


The manner of his escape was clear
enough, and,—favoured as the abominable
deed had been by chance,—easy enough
to understand. Wiping the hammer on
the clothes of the murdered man, he
concealed it again under his blouse, ancl crept
down-stairs. He then went into the
storeroom opening on to the court, in the window
whereof, as we may remember, a pane had
been taken out. He admitted that he had
himself, during the night, extracted this
<!-- Leaf 204, Page: 190 -->
window-pane quite at his ease. The
opening was large, sufficient to allow of the
passage of a man's body. He got out that
way into the court, and crossed it to the
kitchen garden. There he found the pair
of shoes of which we have heard; and there
another act of the drama took place, which
we will give in the Breton's own words.


\"I took off my own shoes where the
pavement of the courtyard ceased, tied them
with their own laces to my leathern belt,
ancl waited."  
  
  
  " For whom ?" asked the Juge.


"For the devil," was the reply; "and
he came quickly. He gave me the box; it
was a small one that used to stand on the
top of a press in Monsieur's room; it had
no key; it shut with a hook only; he
opened it, showed me the gold and the
<!-- Leaf 205, Page: 191 -->
pocket-book; shut it again, and I put it
under my arm and went away. To cross
the garden so as to mislead by the
footmarks, I shoved the fore part of my feet
into the shoes, and walked as well as I
could,—it is a very short distance,—trying
to make a very heavy indent in the earth.
Outside the garden comes the field that
leads down to the little stream running into
the Cholet high-road. There was not a soul
anywhere within sight;—seven o'clock had
not yet struck;—so I made my way across
the field down to the edge of the stream."


"Still in those small shoes?" inquired
the Juge.


\"Still with the fore part of my feet in
those shoes," was the answer.


"It's impossible," retorted the
magistrate; " simply impossible ! "
<!-- Leaf 206, Page: 192 -->

"Then ask me nothing more," was the
bucheron's rejoinder; and half an hour was
spent in inducing him to speak. Then he
resumed his story.


\"On the edge of the water," he said,
\"I rested, took off the shoes, opened the
box,—which was just big enough to hold
them,—put them into it, and walked
barefoot down the stream to the road. All trace
was then lost. I dropped my hammer
among the stones at the bottom of the
water, ancl if you look for it there, you will
find it. I now put on my own shoes, saw
that there was no one in sight, crossed
the high-road quickly, plunged into the
wroods on the opposite side, and knew I
was safe then. I made my way round, by
a detour of more than an hour, to the place
where I was arrested the other day, and
<!-- Leaf 207, Page: 193 -->
where I have lived almost ever since. I
buried the box there, and over it I raised
at first a hut of branches and twigs, where
I could find shelter if it rained hard; later,
I built what stands there now, and I tried
to construct a chapel."  
  
  
  " AVhen did you do that ?" was asked.  
  
  
  " After the Feast for the Dead."


Beyond this, nothing was to be learnt,
and all the bullying of the Juge
d'lnstruction was of no use. The hammer was
sought for in the stream, and found; and,
so far, the old man's statements received
material confirmation. But the Juge
d'Instruction, whose mind was made up
beforehand, would not accept one word about the
use made of the shoes. These fitted Eaoul
de Morville perfectly, and that was proof
enough of his guilt,—more than sufficient,  
  
  
  VOL. II. o
<!-- Leaf 208, Page: 194 -->
combined with his letter to the murdered
man.


To do Eichard Prevost justice, the fact
of his having had to produce this letter
seemed to cause him unutterable pain.
The Cure called upon him, and, as a
friend of Eaoul's, spoke to him upon the
fearful subject, and was touched by the
grief he showed. Monsieur Eichard
inquired from him to what it was possible
that Eaoul alluded by the closing words
of his letter to old Prevost, in which he
mentioned a "service" rendered to his
mother ? The Cure said there was a very
good reason for it.


\"It was in the time of my predecessor,"
he recounted. " I was then Vicaire of
D, and afready intimate at the
Chateau, and at La Morvilliere. Madame de
<!-- Leaf 209, Page: 195 -->
Morville and Madame de Yeraneour were
bosom friends, and I was the intermediary
of the charities their limited means allowed
them to dispense. Madame de Morville
was just eighteen, and a wife of not a
year's standing. Old Madame Prevost,
your uncle's mother, was an old woman,
who died a couple of years later. I would
fain not speak ill of my neighbour, but I
believe your uncle's father to have been
about as completely wanting in all good
qualities as ever man was. He ill-treated
his wretched wife, who was older than
himself, and above all, he insisted on her
openly professing the impious doctrines he
himself professed. The unhappy woman,—
who had no particular convictions of any
kind, and no great stock of goodness either,  
  
  
  -had one tender point. Your uncle Martin
<!-- Leaf 210, Page: 196 -->
was then a young man. He fell ill of
typhus fever, and was at death's door. La
Mere Prevost, as she was called, was in
such despair, that she came in secret to
my superior, the then Cure of D, and
implored his help. He did what he thought
right;—I don't think it was so;—he told
her to repent, to do penance, to return to
her religious duties, and to give whatever
she could in charity. She brought him
five hundred francs the next day! But
now comes the pith of the story. WTiere
did she get them? It was supposed she
had stolen them from her husband! One
thing is certain, that at the end of the
month she was in great danger of being
turned out of doors or beaten to death. His
avarice was beyond description. Madame
de Morville saved her. She gave her all
<!-- Leaf 211, Page: 197 -->
she had, which was three hundred francs,
and borrowed two from Madame de
Verancour, which she repaid little by little.
What they feared was, that our Cure should
get into trouble, which he would have done
had your uncle's father found out what
had happened. But any how, Madame de
Morville saved your great aunt; and she
never forgot it; for in her last illness,—
she became devout after Prevost died,—I
myself heard her tell her son never to forget
what she owed to Madame de Morville."


"And Monsieur Eaoul knew of this?"
asked Eichard Prevost.


\"I think Madame de Verancour told it
him when he was a boy; but I am not quite
certain."


With Monsieur de Morville the case stood
ill, and in the mind of the Juge
<!-- Leaf 212, Page: 198 -->
d'lnstruction his guilt was evident. Prosper Morel
said he did not believe they had ever spoken
together. This was at once disproved by
the church beadle, who, on the day of All
Souls, saw Eaoul return into church after
every one had left, and remain " in close
conversation,"—so he stated,—with Prosper
Morel " for full ten minutes,"—the Juge
wanted him to say a quarter of an hour,
but he wouldn't. This was directly after
the Cure's famous sermon.


Then the Verancour family, and Monsieur
Eichard, and Monsieur le Cure had all
recognised Eaoul late one night on the road,
coming out of the path leading up to
Prosper's abode ! AVhere could he be coming
from, if not from visiting his accomplice ?


And the fatal shoes, too, that fitted him
so well!
<!-- Leaf 213, Page: 199 -->

All went against Eaoul; and when the
Juge thought he had already morally
convicted him, he resolved to crush him past all
possible resistance, with his own terrible
letter. " And now, pray, what do you
say to that ? " he exclaimed, triumphantly,
after reading the document. " Do you deny
having written it ? "


\"Certainly not! " replied Eaoul proudly,
\"for it affords one clear proof of my
innocence. I did write it, and Monsieur Prevost
answered it, and answered it by sending me
the two thousand francs ! "


At this, the exasperation of the
magistrate knew no bounds; he positively
insulted the prisoner; but Eaoul flatly
refused to answer one other question until
he had been allowed to write to his uncle
the admiral in Paris, to send him Martin
<!-- Leaf 214, Page: 200 -->
Prevost's letter. He wrote, sent the key
of the secretaire in which the letter was
kept, and then told the Juge d'Instruction
he would not submit to any further inquiry
till the answer came. It would be
fortyeight hours' delay, still there was no
preventing it; but what puzzled and annoyed
the Juge more than the delay was that, if
Martin Prevost really had of his own free
will lent Eaoul the two thousand francs,
half of the case for the prosecution was
destroyed.


And "la vindicte publique!" where
would that be ?
<!-- Leaf 215 -->
  
  CHAPTEE XXIII.  
  
  
  THE TRIAL.

Not only the letter came, but the Admiral
himself brought it, and at this point nothing
could be clearer than the defence. Martin
Prevost's letter to Eaoul was dated the 13th
of October, the day before his death, and
ran thus:—  
  
  
  " My dear young Friend,

\"I have well considered your request,
and I have decided to grant it. Here are
the two thousand francs for which you seem
<!-- Leaf 216, Page: 202 -->
to have such pressing need. You most
likely exaggerate the use they will be
to you; if not, I shall be glad to have
helped you, and if they do serve you, and
you repay me, you will have taught me that
a kindness is not always thrown away.
Hitherto I have foimd that it did no
good whatever, either to the doer or the
receiver.  
  
  
  "Yours truly,  
  
  
  "Martin Prevost."


The Juge d'Instruction was so vexed that
he tried several means of neutralising the
effect of this document;—suggested that it
might be forged ! but its authenticity was
immediately proved. Then he flatly declared
that it did not diminish the probability of
the prisoner's guilt, for that he might,
<!-- Leaf 217, Page: 203 -->
having received these two thousand francs,
have murdered old Prevost in order to
obtain more.


Eaoul had been forced to avow a part of
the real truth, and to admit that this sum of
two thousand francs was given to M. Leon
Duprez that he might speculate with it.
This was tortured into a heavy charge
against him, and he was denounced as one
of those adventurers of our age, who will
do anything to get money !


Eaoul now confessed that when the sum
confided to Leon Duprez was lost, his
position became—to himself—intolerable, for he
was no longer indebted to a man who,
remembering the service rendered to his own
mother by Madame de Morville, requited it
voluntarily by a service to the latter's son;
he stood indebted to Monsieur Eichard
<!-- Leaf 218, Page: 204 -->
Prevost, a man he scarcely knew, and had no
particular reason to like, and he could not
even reveal the circumstance of the debt
owing to the uncle. " I had but one thing
for ever before my eyes," said Eaoul;
\"the necessity for saving every sou of my
salary, in order one day to be able to relate
the facts to Monsieur Eichard wliile
returning him his money." In order to do this
he had deprived himself of the very
necessaries of life, and this was his simple reason
for taking at night a fourteen miles' walk
across the country instead of paying the
three francs to the diligence from the
station.


Not only did the magistrate refuse to
admit this explanation, but it was evident
that the avowals of pecuniary embarrassment
to which,—-however humiliating they were,
<!-- Leaf 219, Page: 205 -->
—Eaoul was obliged to have recourse,
prejudiced his examiners still more against him.
He was, by his own showing, extremely
poor, therefore, argued the French judicial
mind, capable of anything ! It would take
a vast deal now to make out his innocence.
The Admiral,—who discovered his nephew's
real position in all its details for the first
time,—behaved admirably, and assured
Eichard Prevost that the money owing to
his uncle should be refunded in a week,
the time to write to Paris and go through
the formalities of getting the sum cashed
through the Post Office. This did
something, but still other circumstances were not
got rid of; and one fresh circumstance had
occurred which looked very ugly indeed for
Monsieur de Morville.  
  
  
  It was proved by two or three witnesses
<!-- Leaf 220, Page: 206 -->
that the letter E was written over and over
by the Breton between, or by the side of,
the P's and M's. They were great big
capital letters. They were existent on the
25th of April,—the day of the St. Marc,—
and they were non-existent on the morning
of the 27th, when the Maire went up to La
Chapelle a Prosper. Now, a dozen persons
remembered Eaoul's presence at the fete of
the 25th, and his being one of the group to
whom the son of the Juge de Paix told the
story of the " large capital E's," after which
the Maire had said he would go up and " see
the whole with his own eyes."


But worse again than this, a farm labourer
who was coming across from Jouzy in the
middle of the night of the 26th, and who
took the short cut by the path leading near
Prosper's shed, was surprised by seeing some
<!-- Leaf 221, Page: 207 -->
one rubbing very hard at the board where
the Breton's " images " were known to be
drawn. He thought it was the bucheron
himself, and went nearer, but it was not
him, it was a bourgeois, and he wore a straw
hat.


"Was it like the one the prisoner usually
wore ? " asked the Juge.


\"Well;—" the witness couldn't say,
\"but he rather thought it was ! " It was
bright moonlight, but he only saw the man's
back. Witness was in a great hurry, for he
was going to see his wife who was in service
at D, and who was ill, and he had to
be back again at Jouzy by seven or eight
o'clock in the morning. This again told
sadly against Eaoul. Evidently the letters
meant Prosper and Morel, and Eaoul and
Morville; the thing was as clear as day,
<!-- Leaf 222, Page: 208 -->
and all further interrogatories now were
time wasted; so at least the Juge opined;
and he made out the committal of both
prisoners, who were despatched to the
central gaol of the department, situate in
the chef-lieu.


Six wreeks passed by, and towards the
middle of June the case was to come on.
The chef-lieu du departement was a small
town, and could scarcely house all the people
who flocked to it to be present at the trial.
Besides that, a large number of the principal
inhabitants of D were forced to attend
as witnesses. The Verancour family, the
Cure, Eichard Prevost, the doctor, the Maire,
in short most of the notables of D had
to take up their quarters for a few days, at
all events, at the assize town.  
  
  
  The acte d'accusation was made out with
<!-- Leaf 223, Page: 209 -->
an unmistakable animus against Eaoul,
whilst the Breton was treated as a WTetched,
weak-witted, superstitious tool in the younger
man's hands; and after the trial had lasted
three days the impression touching Monsieur
de Morville's culpability had not been
removed. Monsieur le Cure's persuasion of
his innocence had never varied from the
moment the letter from old Prevost was
found sending him the two thousand francs.
He scouted all idea of his not being loudly
pronounced guiltless, and obliged poor
Vevette to share his belief, and to
preserve strength enough to hide her own
secret from her father and sister.


It was a lovely June evening, and Felicie
and Yevette were sitting at the open window
of their little salon in the hotel of the
"Armes de Bretagne," when the doctor  
  
  
  VOL. II. p
<!-- Leaf 224, Page: 210 -->
came in. "Well," cried Vevette, eagerly,
"to day's 'audience' seems to have been
very favourable ! Papa's testimony, he
thinks, produced a real effect. What a
shame it is to keep on torturing a man in
such a way when they know he is innocent,
and that he must be acquitted ! "


\"Doctor," said Felicie, more calmly, " you
look uneasy; has anything fresh occurred ?
The trial lasted long to-day."


\"Yes," rejoined the doctor, " something
has happened that is unpleasant. The
testimony of the man, Colin Mercier, who saw
some one rubbing at the black board behind
Prosper's chapel, but did not see who it was,
might be got over, for Monsieur Eaoul had
probability on his side when he said that it
would have been a most extraordinary fact
that he should be up in the woods at one
<!-- Leaf 225, Page: 211 -->
o'clock in the morning instead of being
quietly at home in his bed; but "


\"So then it was at one o'clock in the
morning that the man was seen rubbing out
those great big E's ? " interrupted Vevette,
with an accent of contempt.


"Yes," replied the doctor, "but that is
not all. Eaoul's argument was destroyed.
For unhappily at eleven o'clock on that very
same night Eaoul was met by Daniel
Leroux, the farrier, coming down the lane
from the church at D, and after
exchanging a bon soir with him, Daniel saw
him walk on towards the high road and
cross it."


"Mon Dieu!" cried Felicie, with a
vivacity unusual in her, " Mon Dieu ! this is
dreadful."  
  
  
  " It is very perplexing," added the doctor
<!-- Leaf 226, Page: 212 -->
thoughtfully, "for this time, you see, he
wras recognised."


"Wbat did Eaoul say to that?" asked
Felicie, with anxiety.


\"He turned white as a sheet, I am sorry
to say, and absolutely refused to answer any
other question."


\"The case stands thus, then," observed
Vevette, who had neither stirred nor spoken;
\"at one o'clock on the night of the 26th to
the 27th, Eaoul is now supposed to have
been seen erasing those initial letters which
point at him, and at eleven on that night he
was positively spoken to on the road. That
is a strong case against him," she added
slowly, and with a curious intensity of look
and tone.  
  
  
  " It is so," replied the doctor.  
  
  
  Vevette seemed absorbed in her
<!-- Leaf 227, Page: 213 -->
reflections. " As he is not guilty," she said after
a pause, and as if speaking to herself,
"there is a murderer somewhere,—but who
is it ? "


"Probably old Prosper alone," remarked
the doctor, " and all the rest is in his
imagination; but the case is a bad one for
Monsieur Eaoul, for, unluckily, when you come
to have to do with justice, innocence and
acquittal are not the same thing."


\"And Eaoul might be condemned ? "
said Yevette.


\"You take it quietly ! " retorted Felicie;
\"but it is a most horrible thing. And the
question is of the life of a man we have
known all our lives,—a man of our own
class, too !"


\"Human life is an awful thing before
God, be it whose it may;" murmured
<!-- Leaf 228, Page: 214 -->
Yevette, and there was a solemnity about
her that must have struck her two
companions had they not been too busy with
their own thoughts.


Vevette sat still and silent till the doctor
rose to go, and then she rose too, and left
the room. It was twilight now, and the
moon was just heaving herself slowly up
behind the towers of the cathedral. It was
a glorious evening. The next morning was
the fourth day of the trial, and at ten o'clock
as usual the judges took their seats upon the
bench. The court was crowded, as it had
been on each day. The windows had to be
opened on account of the heat, and a long
ray of bright sunlight streamed in, and fell
upon the crucifix at the extreme end of the
long low hall, and just at the President's
back.
<!-- Leaf 229, Page: 215 -->

The prisoners were brought in, and,
accompanied by the gendarmes, took their places
on the seats allotted for the accused. The
Breton looked as he had done all along, a
perfect type of illuminated stupidity, if you
can conceive the two things going together.
Half of the time he was on his knees, with
his bony hands clasped together on his
breast, or busy telling a big chaplet of
wooden beads, with his wandering eyes
glaring out of his gaunt head, casting mute
appealing glances at the crucifix. In Eaoul
there was a great change; a fearful change
since the previous day; so said those who had
been present at the last audience. He was
frightfully pale, and there was an air of
stern despair about him that chilled those
who gazed.  
  
  
  Just as the President was about to declare
<!-- Leaf 230, Page: 216 -->
the day's sitting open, an usher of the court
was observed to put a letter into his hands.
The judge read it apparently with great
attention, and then, as he seated himself, said :
—" In virtue of our discretionary powers
we admit Mademoiselle Genevieve de
Verancour to depose to a fact which bears upon
the present important and complicated trial.
Let her come forward."


At these words Eaoul started back as
though he had been shot, and leant against
the wooden partition which separated the
dock from the public. Through the crowd
there ran one of those quivering vibrations
familiar to all who know the magnetic
impulses of crowds, and this was followed
by a deathlike stillness, as through the
parting waves of the human sea two figures
passed, preceded by the usher of the court.
<!-- Leaf 231, Page: 217 -->
It was the silence of awe. Vevette, simply
attired in a plain grey stuff gown, with a
little white bonnet, and black veil, came
forward, leaning upon the arm of the Cure
for support.


"Collect yourself, and do not be alarmed,"
said the President kindly, as the Cure took
off the veil from the sweet face of the girl,
who at that moment seemed to have fainted.
\"Let a chair be brought for the witness."


But she had recovered herself already.
"I can stand," she said, in a low but
audible tone, and she came one step forward,
resting her left hand upon the Cure's stout
right arm. "lam quite ready."


\"Your name, age, and domicile ? " asked
the President, with an expression which
was almost paternal in spite of his august
and terrible functions.
<!-- Leaf 232, Page: 218 -->

\"Marie Angelique Anne Genevieve de
Verancour; seventeen last March; resident
at the Chateau de D—■—," was the reply,
in a low but firm voice.


"You have a deposition to make which
Monsieur le Cure of D tells us is of
great importance to the case under
examination; is that so ? "


The girl trembled convulsively, made a
hurried sign of the cross, and as though,
at the last, moment, losing all her courage,
clasped her hands in agony, and turning
to the priest, ejaculated : — " Oh, mon
pere!"


Eaoul dropped upon both knees, buried
his head upon his arms crossed upon the
bar, and groaned audibly. AVhite, as
though every drop of blood had left her,
stiff as though she were a corpse risen out
<!-- Leaf 233, Page: 219 -->
of her coffin, Vevette now stood forward, and
in a voice, the singularly penetrating tones
of which will be remembered to their dying
day by all who heard them, she spoke thus:
\"Monsieur le President, on the night of
the 26th to the 27th of April last, at one
o'clock after midnight, Monsieur Eaoul de
Morville was with me in the pavilion
of the garden belonging to my father's
house,—the pavilion, the entrance to which
is through the door in the so-called '
Earnpart,' opening into the lane leading to the
church. At a little before twelve he first
came into the pavilion, where I had been
waiting for him from a little past ten. It
was a good deal past one when he left,
This I affirm upon oath."


There ran a hushed murmur through the
crowd like the whisper of the awakening
<!-- Leaf 234, Page: 220 -->
wind through leafy trees. Every
individual ear and eye were strained towards
Mademoiselle de Verancour, every
individual breath was held. " God in heaven
bless the girl!" suddenly burst from the
lips of the poor Admiral, down whose
bronzed cheeks the tears trickled
unconsciously. " She is a hero !"


The President imposed silence on the
public, and saying it was necessary to resist
all emotion, proceeded with his formal
interrogatory. Wben he asked the accused
what he had to say to the statement of
the last witness, Eaoul raised his head, and
cast an involuntary look of such passionate
love at Yevette that it stirred the soul of
every man and woman there, and then,
lowering his eyes to the ground, "
Mademoiselle de Verancour," said he, " was my
<!-- Leaf 235, Page: 221 -->
dead sister's friend; we have all been
brought up together as brother ancl sisters;
she has wished to save my life; but I
cannot admit the truth of her
depositions."


But at this Vevette rose up, lovingly
indignant. All shame was gone, and all
girlish indecision. The woman was there
fighting for her love, and stepping forward
to the table iu front of the bench, on which
were laid the written accusations, she spoke
again. " Monsieur le President," she said,
in a clear, sweet voice that rang through
the court, " I ask permission to make a
detailed statement of facts. We shall see
whether Monsieur de Morville will deny
what I have to assert. It is true we were
brought up together as brother and sister;
but we grew to be more; and we had sworn
<!-- Leaf 236, Page: 222 -->
to each other to be one day man and wife.
Monsieur de Morville's object in life was
to earn honourably what would render it
possible for him to ask my father for my
hand. I did not know of the hopes he had
had of a quicker realisation of this wish.
I knew that his uncle the Admiral had
obtained for him a position in Paris. WTien
the father of Monsieur de Morville fell
suddenly ill, and he returned to D 
on leave, I saw at once that he was very
unhappy, and I feared 1 can't say
what; for I had but one fear, lest
something should separate us. We had no
means of meeting save in secret, and that
was extremely difficult. He was to return
to Paris in a few days; I was too wretched !
I could not bear it ! I wrote to him and
told him to come to the pavilion in the
<!-- Leaf 237, Page: 223 -->
garden at ten or half-past ten at night,
where I would meet him. I was sure every
one would be gone to bed by that time, and
that I could go out without being perceived.
I was in the pavilion before half-past ten,
and I waited. I heard every hour and half
hour strike;—half-past nine, then ten,
then half-past, then eleven, and then
halfpast eleven; and then at last he came, and
we talked long of all our hopes and fears.
It was likely to be our last meeting for we
could not say how long; and we were, and
we are, all in the whole world to each
other ! At last one o'clock struck !
Everybody knows what a loud deep bell oui1
parish church has. You can hear it miles
distant. When I heard that, I was
frightened, and told him it was time for him to
go. We spoke a few more last words and
<!-- Leaf 238, Page: 224 -->
then we parted, and when I ascended the
terrace steps and went through the
diningroom window, the half-hour after one was
striking. Ask Monsieur de Morville if he
can deny that!" she added, a smile of
absolute triumph curling her fevered lips.
\"Ask him for the few lines I wrote to him.
He will have certainly kept them ! "


"Accused, what have you to say?"
repeated the President,


But Eaoul was powerless; crushed by
both despair and joy. To have the
intensity of poor Vevette's love for him
thus proved, and at the same time to feel
that were she his wife the next day it
would not, in public esteem, restore the
bloom to her honour; this was too much,
and coming after so much misery it utterly
vanquished him. He had covered his face
<!-- Leaf 239, Page: 225 -->
with his hands, and was sobbing like a
child. There were few in the crowd who
were not weeping too, at sight of these
two poor young lovers, who were trying
so hard to see which should sacrifice most
to the other.


At last, Monsieur de Morville stood up,
and, with quivering features, said,
"Monsieur le President! I appeal to you not as
a judge, but as a man. I cannot answer !
You feel that I have nothing to say !"


\"Then I have !" exclaimed Mademoiselle
de Verancour, and, turning towards the
prisoner—


\"Eaoul !" she cried, " remember that
the worst is told. On your life hangs my
life, and my honour can only be retrieved
by our love. Eaoul, for the love of God, and
for my sake, speak, and tell all the truth !"  
  
  
  VOL. II. Q
<!-- Leaf 240, Page: 226 -->

There was a pause, during which you
heard how each man held his breath, and
then, with downcast eyes and singular
embarrassment, Eaoul confirmed all that
Vevette had said.


\"When did you receive the witness's
letter ?" was asked of him.


"About eight o'clock, at the cafe. I
had but just time to run across the
fields to La Morvilliere, speak to Brigitte,
—my father's old servant,-—make her
believe I was gone to bed, and then steal out
of the house by the back way, and walk
back again to D It takes a good
hour and a quarter to go from D to
our house, and it was striking eleven when
I turned into the lane that skirts the
kitchen garden of the Chateau. I stopped
to see that there was no one near, and I
<!-- Leaf 241, Page: 227 -->
heard footsteps. I walked clown the lane,
and Daniel Leroux, the farrier, passed. He
said good-night to me, and I answered his
greeting. The last stroke of eleven was
striking then. I immediately went on.
Instead of going to the gate that opens
into the garden, I went past it, walked
right by Leroux, keeping before him till
I reached the high road, there I crossed,
and went straight into the woods, watching
to see him out of sight. He took to the
right hand up the road towards his own
house, and when I no longer feared to be
seen, I came out from the trees, re-crossed
the road, ran down the lane, opened the
gate, and in the pavilion found Ye—
Mademoiselle Genevieve waiting. All she
has said is true," he concluded in an almost
inaudible voice. At this moment Eaoul's
<!-- Leaf 242, Page: 228 -->
innocence was the innate conviction of
every human being present; but there was
still a great deal to be elucidated.


"How did you contrive to get your note
given to Monsieur de Morville?" inquired
the President.


\"I gave it to Mere Jubine's daughter
Louison," replied Vevette, blushing deeply.  
  
  
  "At what hour?"  
  
  
  " At about four."  
  
  
  " Did you tell her to deliver it directly ?"  
  
  
  "Yes; at once, without any delay."


Louise Jubine, who was amongst the
witnesses, and had afready deposed to some
minor detail, was recalled. She was a very
fine-looking girl, rather over-dressed for her
station.


After the prebminary questions, all of
which she answered in confirmation of
<!-- Leaf 243, Page: 229 -->
Vevette's deposition, the President
addressed her. "If you received that note
at four, with charge to deliver it at once,
why did you only give it to the accused at
past eight ?"


Louison hung her head, grew scarlet,
twisted her cap-strings round her fingers,
and said she had " rather not reply."


"But you must reply," retorted the
Judge, sternly. " You are upon oath,
and if you don't answer truly, I will send
you to prison."


Louison trembled all over, but when
the question was again put she stammered
out—


\"Because, before taking it to Monsieur
Eaoul, I gave it to Monsiem" Eichard
Prevost." A strange murmur arose from the
crowd at this announcement.
<!-- Leaf 244, Page: 230 -->

"Why did you do this?" inquired the
Judge. " Tell the whole truth, girl, or
beware of the consequences."


\"Because," she answered, with a little
less difficulty, " Monsieur Eichard had told
me, ever since Monsieur Eaoul's return
from Paris, always to tell him everything
that went on between Monsieur Eaoul
and the Chateau, and particularly
whatever concerned Monsieur Eaoul and
Mademoiselle Vevette."


"And you were so intimate with
Monsieur Eichard that you implicitly obeyed all
his commands ? " added the Judge.


The girl put her handkerchief to her face,
and her reply was inaudible. Monsieur
Eichard was now called as a witness and
sworn in. He looked ghastly. He said
the heat and his long-continued state of ill
<!-- Leaf 245, Page: 231 -->
health made him quite faint. The
President ordered a chair to be brought for the
witness. When the question was put to
him, Why he had given to Louise Jubine
the directions she had stated, he said he was
absolutely ignorant of the whole thing, and
that Louison had invented the entire story.
And so saying, he attempted to make Ught
of it, and smile, but his lips stuck to his
teeth as though they were gummed, and the
smile wouldn't come.


All this time the bucheron had remained
immovable, muttering his prayers, telling
his beads, and gazing at the crucifix.
\"Prosper Morel! " said the President,
\"do you still persist in declaring that
Eaoul de Morville was not youraccomplice?"  
  
  
  " I don't know him ! " reiterated the old
<!-- Leaf 246, Page: 232 -->
man, with a gesture of impatience. " I
have said so all along."  
  
  
  " Then who was your accomplice ?"


\"I will not answer that," mumbled the
woodcutter. " I murdered my master. Let
me go to my doom in peace. Let me go to
my expiation! "


\"Prosper Morel! " suddenly exclaimed
the Cure, in a loud, solemn tone, ancl the
prisoner rose to his feet mechanically, and
stood stiff as a soldier at " attention."
\"Prosper Morel! " he repeated, " I told
you to distrust your own heart, and to
beware of revenge; but the truth must out.
You must speak, for your silence will cause
a second murder to be committed."—The
Breton shook and shrunk into himself.—
\"Prosper Morel! as you hope at your last
hour for forgiveness from Him,"—and the
<!-- Leaf 247, Page: 233 -->
priest stretched forth his arm and pointed at
the figure of Christ over the tribunal,—
\"tell the whole truth now ! The innocent
must be saved. Who was it tempted you
to murder Martin Prevost ?"


The old man clutched his beads with a
tighter grasp, and as though compelled by
a power he dared not resist. " Monsieur
Eichard ! " he said, in a hollow tone, and
then took to telling his beads again, as
though he were telling them for his very
soul.
<!-- Leaf 248 -->
  
  CHAPTEE XXIV.  
  
  
  THE SENTENCE.

The whole situation was altogether changed
by the arrest ancl imprisonment of Eichard
Prevost, which ensued immediately on
Prosper's confession. After the first few
preliminary questions had been put to the
woodcutter and to his newly-discovered
accomplice, the proceedings of that day were
suddenly brought to a close, and the trial
was suspended for two or three days, while
a fresh act of indictment was made out,
<!-- Leaf 249, Page: 235 -->
which placed Monsieur Eichard by the
side of the other two prisoners, accused of
the murder of his uncle, Martin Prevost.
During this short lapse of time poor Vevette
had other terrible battles to fight; but
nothing daunted her now, and she fought
all her enemies stoutly,—even her father
and sister. As might be supposed,
Mademoiselle Felicie's virtuous resentment passed
all description, and she was for adopting the
most stringent measures. The Vicomte
had decreed the immediate removal of his
erring child to her convent at Poitiers, in
spite of the protests and supplications of the
Cure of D The Admiral proposed that
a first cousin of his own, an elderly widow
lady, inhabiting a country house in the
environs of the chef-lieu, and proverbial
for the severity of her morals and piety,
<!-- Leaf 250, Page: 236 -->
should take charge of Mademoiselle de
Verancour till her marriage with Monsieur de
Morville. " She shall never marry him,"
had replied the Vicomte.


When this was repeated to Vevette, she
merely sat down and wrote a note to her
father, of which she sent a copy to her sister
also. It only contained these words:—
\"You have forced me into rebellion, when
all I asked was humbly to implore your
pardon. Marry Eaoul I will. I would
have married him at the foot of the scaffold.
If any obstacle be put in the way of this
union, and of my possibility of doing my
duty and ensuring his happiness, I will
proclaim the betrothal of my sister to Eichard
Prevost in all its details. I am driven to
this. I would rather die than do it, but I
will not sacrifice Eaoul." The answer to
<!-- Leaf 251, Page: 237 -->
this was, that the unnatural ancl abandoned
girl might do what she chose, and go
whither she listed; that her father cast her
off, and desired never again to hear her
name.


Febcie's secret was saved, and the
Admiral, accompanied by the Cure, placed
Vevette under the care of the Baronne de
Preville, who for the time being promised
to be as a mother to her.


The trial was resumed three days after its
suspension, and in the corner of the seat
devoted to the accused was now seated
Monsieur Eichard, a miserable object truly;
so wizened and shrivelled that twenty years
seemed to have passed over him; and as he
sat, with his head propped upon a pillow,
be perpetually smelt at a bottle of
eau-deCologne, and seemed for ever trying to
<!-- Leaf 252, Page: 238 -->
persuade himself that, rich as he was, no harm
could in the end come to him. His defence
of himself was so utterly weak and silly, he
so evidently broke down the instant he was
seized in the pitiless machinery of legal
investigation, that morally his guilt was
plain at once, and—said the technical men—
\"he deprived the case of all its interest from
the outset."


Eaoul's position was now a totally altered
one, and his whole bearing showed it, He
knew his innocence was triumphantly proved,
and he could afford to feel, if not pity for
the two wretched men between whom he
stood, at all events awe at what was likely
to be the judgment for their crime. The
aspect of old Prosper had also undergone a
change. All traces of insanity had
disappeared, but a terrible war was being waged
<!-- Leaf 253, Page: 239 -->
by the Breton between his gratified revenge
and his strong desire not to imperil his
immortal soul. Every now ancl then a glance
of tiger-like fierceness shot out from his
eyes, and went scorching over his
fellowculprit, to be suddenly atoned for by
convulsive mutterings of prayers.


The story told by Prosper Morel wTas
simply this :—His master had, upon the last
complaint made against him by the Maire
for poaching, discharged him with such
exceeding harshness, that he had vowed to be
revenged. Besides, he had no earthly means
of gaining his bread; and he wras frightened
past all reasoning by the prospect of dying of
hunger in a ditch. Well; his old master
gave him a respite, and consented to keep
him on " for this once;" but he, Prosper,
did not forgive his master, and his flight
<!-- Leaf 254, Page: 240 -->
endured, for he felt he might, be sent adrift
at any hour. Of this state of his mind
\"Monsieur Eichard," as he always called him,
took advantage; and only a very few days
after old Prevost had agreed to give the
bucheron another trial, the young man
tempted him to his fall.


The following wras the mode of
perpetration of the deed :—On the night of the 13th
of October the bucheron, who was lying in
wait in the kitchen garden just beyond
the courtyard, was introduced by Eichard
Prevost into the latter's own room, while
Madame Jean was giving his supper to
Nicholas down in the kitchen. Nothing
could be easier, and concealment was
perfect. Monsieur Eichard, feigning one
of his feverish headaches, said good-night
to his uncle,—who was, as usual, busy
<!-- Leaf 255, Page: 241 -->
with accounts,—and retired to his own
room, where he had concealed Prosper.


The only little circumstance that was at
all out of the common way was elicited from
Madame Jean in her testimony as to what
had occurred on that night. Monsieur
Eichard, she said, invariably slept without
a night-light, having on the table by his
bed-side a candle and a plentiful supply of
lucifer-matches. On the night of the 13th,
however, he said he should like a night-lamp,
for that the pain in his head was so severe
that he might, perhaps, not have strength to
strike a light, should he want one during
the night. A lamp was accordingly placed
on the chimney-piece, and prevented Eichard
Prevost from being in the dark, all alone
with the future murderer of his uncle.  
  
  
  The bucheron's description of the hours  
  
  
  VOL. II. R
<!-- Leaf 256, Page: 242 -->
that then elapsed was that he himself had
slept a good part of the time, but that,
whenever he woke up, he saw Monsieur
Eichard in his arm-chair, sitting up reading
by the light of the little lamp. About five
o'clock, he said, the atmosphere grew chilly,
and Monsieur Eichard shivered very much,
and got up and took a bottle from a cupboard,
and gave him,—Prosper Morel,—a glass of
something to drink, which made him feel
reckless of anything or anybody. It was
neither brandy nor rum;—he knew the taste
of both; it was a wrhite liquor, very strong,
but very bitter. Monsieur Eichard then
softly opened his door, beckoned Prosper on,
and they crossed over the passage to the
lumber-room, where, with the implements
the Breton had in his pockets, they, without
making the least noise, took out the
<!-- Leaf 257, Page: 243 -->
windowpane. That done,—which was the work of
a quarter of an hour,—they went back into
Monsieur Eichard's room, and waited till
Madame Jean should have got up ancl gone
out to mass, and Nicholas have set forth on
the errand to the post-office for which
Monsieur Eichard knew he had had instructions
overnight. A few minutes before half-past
sis the house was empty of every one save
Martin Prevost. When they heard the
house-door close on Madame Jean, Monsieur
Eichard unlocked his room-door, let out
Prosper Morel, ancl, pointing with his finger
to the room up-stairs, whispered these words,
\"Whatever ready money there is in the
caisse shall be yours."


"And then I went up-stairs and did it,"
said the old man; " and when all was over
I stamped three times on the floor,—as we
<!-- Leaf 258, Page: 244 -->
had agreed I should do;—and Monsieur
Eichard came up, but he only came to the
door. He would not come in. He pointed
to a small deal box standing on the
drawers. I brought it to him. Then he
said I must empty the large open drawer of
thc caisse, over which ' Monsieur ' had been
standing when I struck him. I did so.
He put, as I have afready stated, all the gold
and notes and pocket-books into the deal
box, and gave it to me, and then, too, he
showed me the shoes, and I shut '
Monsieur's ' door, and we went down-stairs, and
I got away." The bucheron said he
supposed Monsieur Eichard had gone to bed
directly after he had seen
him,—Prosper,—safely on the other side of the
courtyard.  
  
  
  To all this Eichard Prevost opposed only
<!-- Leaf 259, Page: 245 -->
the weakest system of defence, and so
utterly miserable was his whole attitude,
that upon the face of the eminent barrister
appointed to defend him, and lured down
from Paris at a moment's notice, and at
almost the cost of his own weight in gold,
you might read the blankest disappointment,
and something nearly akin to disgust. His
sagacity, however, quickly told him that on
his own client he could rest no hopes of
success; but that on the eccentricity of
the Breton's character must depend his
last chance of obtaining a mitigation of
his client's fate. So he endeavoured to
prove the absolute madness of the
woodcutter, and built the entire system of
the defence on the fact of Prosper having
been the only murderer, and all the rest
being simply hallucination. But this did
<!-- Leaf 260, Page: 246 -->
not now suit the old man's humour : he had
been brought to tell the whole story, and
now that it was told, he strenuously resisted
every attempt to impugn the thorough
accuracy of his depositions.


\"I was discharged by the Juge
d'lnstruction as innocent," said he. " I had nothing
more to fear. I was free ! If the truth, and
the fear of God's justice had not driven me to
it, I needed never have been where I now am.
For the first few weeks after the deed, I did
not seem to mind it much,—only I did not
like seeing anything that reminded me of
' Monsieur.' I lived up yonder, only coming
down into D to church. But I took to
getting sleepless at nights; and in all my
dreams, when I did sleep, I saw my old
master, and he pursued me and haunted me.
He said he could not get up, and I have
<!-- Leaf 261, Page: 247 -->
sometimes felt him crawling about my feet,
and catching hold of them, and asking me to
help him to get up. Well, then,
the judgment of God came, and on All
Souls'-day of last year He put it into
Monsieur le Cure's mouth to say the words that
were to save my soul. Since then you knowr
all. I have no more to say. I murdered
my master, and now, for the love of our dear
Lord Jesus, let me go to my doom; let me
expiate what I have done, and secure the
salvation of my soul!" Beyond this he
would not go, but every one felt he had told
the truth, and all the rhetoric of the French
bar would have been powerless to alter this
conviction.


When the presiding Judge put it to the
jury whether the three accused were guilty
of the murder of Martin Prevost, those
<!-- Leaf 262, Page: 248 -->
twelve wise citizens returned to the box
after a five minutes' absence, and their
foreman gave as a verdict that, as to the accused
De Morville, not so much as a shade of
suspicion rested upon him; that, as to the
other two, they found Eichard Prevost and
Prosper Morel guilty of the wilful murder
of Martin Prevost, but with " extenuating
circumstances ! "


WTiether these wonderful "
circumstances," inseparable, as it would now seem,
from the verdict delivered upon every
difficult case in France, were really attributable
to the complications of the trial itself, which
passed the understanding of the jury, or to
the eloquence of the defendant's counsel,
was never known.—That eloquent pleader
said the whole was owing to him, and he
was paid in proportion.
<!-- Leaf 263, Page: 249 -->

The sentence was, of course, penal
servitude for life.


WTien the sentence was passed, Eichard
Prevost had fainted, and had to be carried
away apparently lifeless, and the Breton
dropped his beads from his hands, and stood
transfixed. When the gendarmes touched
him and forced him to move, he clasped his
hands as if in agony, and went his way
between the two guardians of the law,
muttering the " De profundis" over and
over, with the convulsive ardour of sheer
despair.
<!-- Leaf 264 -->
  
  CHAPTEE XXV.  
  
  
  CONCLUSION.

During the few days that the bucheron
remained in prison previous to his removal
to his permanent place of detention, he was
quite inconsolable, and inaccessible even to
the arguments of the Cure, who attended
him constantly. His one fixed idea being
that the sacrifice of blood was alone
valuable, and that by his death only could he
expiate his crime, Prosper regarded himself
as doomed to eternal punishment through
the unbelief of his judges. The notion that,
<!-- Leaf 265, Page: 251 -->
from sheer impiety, the earthly umpires of
Ms fate had refused to help him to the
salvation of his soul, so filled the Breton with
rage, that every now and then he gave it
vent in the most fiercely gloomy
denunciations against all his countrymen in general,
but in particular against those of the spot

where he had sinned and been sentenced. It
was of no use that the Cure sought to
persuade him that, by submission, he might
expiate his crime; and that the
longenduring silent horrors of penal servitude
might be turned to an even better account
than death. It was all of no use. Death
was his chimera,—his passion,—and he
despaired because he had been deprived of it.


The two last days, however, of his stay
in prison he had become more calm, had
quietly partaken of his prison fare; and,
<!-- Leaf 266, Page: 252 -->
when told that four-and-twenty hours later
he would be " translated " to his final
destination, he had asked pardon of his jailor for
all the trouble he had given him. When
his cell was opened the next morning he was
found dead. He had hung himseU".


The means by which he achieved his end
were not easy. Dressing himself in his
upper clothing, he had taken off his shirt
and twisted it into a thick rope. He had
contrived to draw his bed under the kind of
square loophole which served him as a
window, and heaping table and chair upon
the bed, had been able to reach the iron
bars, round which he managed to knot his
newly-invented cord. The rest was not
difficult. It merely required the overthrow
of the chair and table. Both were found
upon the ground. The old man had
<!-- Leaf 267, Page: 253 -->
accomplished his purpose, and had carried out
what he believed to be the law. In his
dark, superstitious mind the fact of the
punishment constituted everything, and in
his craving to be redeemed by paying the
price of blood, he wholly lost sight of the
sin of self-murder.


As to Eichard Prevost, it was impossible
to execute his sentence, for he never left his
bed again, and lingered two months in the
gaol infirmary. He shrunk from the Cure of
D, but longed for doctors, for he fancied
they could make him live; and he loved Use
so dearly ! It was all one that Use was to
be infamy. It was life !—That it was to
be poverty, labour, silence, solitude,—no
matter; it was to be life !—To go on
breathing, feeding, sleeping, and waiting for the
next day ! Dr. Javal came from Cholet, and
<!-- Leaf 268, Page: 254 -->
examined him, and said there was no need
for him to die; and Eichard caught at this,
and would have kissed Dr. Javal's hands;
and the old doctor from D, with a queer
sort of expression on his face, observed, that
there might be no need for him to die, but
that the great difficulty was that, somehow
or other, he couldn't live. " People will die
sometimes," said he, " although we think
they ought to remain alive." After passing
through a species of typhus-fever, and
jaundice, and then a low fever that resembled
ague, Eichard Prevost was obliged to hear
that he had not many days to live, and that
he had better wind up his accounts with the
other world. This announcement terrified
him less than had been supposed, for his
strength was so exhausted that the tight
grip itself with which he had held life was
<!-- Leaf 269, Page: 255 -->
relaxing, and he woidd probably let existence
go without any very great struggle.


And so it was. When " the time came,"
he had no longer any power left wherewith
to retain what he had ceased to be able to
use, or, indeed, to comprehend. He sent
to St. Philbert for the Abbe le Boy, and
confessed to him. The strong piety, the
robust faith of the Cure of D—-—- were  
  
  
  were

too much for him; he dreaded them, and
foresaw comfort in the small practices ancl
small prayers, in the medals, beads, and
images of the narrow-minded priest of St.
Philbert. He wanted some one to hush-up
his conscience and tell him " not to be
afraid;" and this he got. The Abbe le
Eoy, indeed, called his end an edifying one;
and, from the way in which he spoke of
it, very nearly ran the risk of inspiring
<!-- Leaf 270, Page: 256 -->
naughty boys with the notion that crime
was a fine thing if it necessarily brought
about such sweet humility in the departing
criminal. Eichard Prevost confessed. Yes,
confessed everything ! and did not seem to
find any particular hardship therein.


When all was told, of course the Abbe
le Eoy impressed upon his penitent the
necessity of making public whatever was
not of a private nature in his confession;
so that, while the name of Felicie was never
guessed at by a living creature, the details of
tbe crime Eichard had instigated were fully
revealed. Every word the Breton had spoken
was strictly true. Eichard Prevost had
tempted him to murder the old man, ancl the
murder was committed precisely as Prosper
Morel had stated. The one thing alone
about which Eichard really did seem to
<!-- Leaf 271, Page: 257 -->
care was Eaoul de Morville's forgiveness,
which, of course, was generously granted.
He said he could not "Withstand what the
circumstances of Eaoul's letter prompted
him to do; and once that letter in the hands
of the Juge cl'Instruction, things took
thenown course, and Eichard Prevost believed
himseU safe.


He had heard with terror of the " capital
E's " drawn by Prosper amongst his other
figures, and resolved to invent some means
of destroying them;—for he thought they
indicated an intention on Prosper's part to
accuse him. He had naturally kept watch
on Eaoul,—ancl enlisted Louison for that
purpose into his service;—for he never
knew wiiat might occur; and when he read
Vevette's note to Eaoul, he,—Eichard,—
felt certain that there must be two or three  
  
  
  VOL. II. s
<!-- Leaf 272, Page: 258 -->
hours in the night for the employment of
which Eaoul could never account. By
this he profited; stole out of his own
house by the back way, Avent up to the
bucheron's shed, found him asleep, effaced
all trace of the fatal letters, and believed
no one had seen him; but persuaded
himself that, had any one done so, it would be
easy to turn suspicion towards Monsieur de
Morville.  
  
  
  When Eichard Prevost had ended his

terrible confession, the Abbe le Eoy began
to indulge in descriptions of the various
and irresistible forms which "the demon"
takes in order to lead men astray; and by
sheer force of habit, he warned his penitent,
as if there were any further opportunities
of transgression lying before him. Above
all, he was hard upon Satan, for having
<!-- Leaf 273, Page: 259 -->
assumed the shape of the unwitting, and
so pious, and well brought up
Mademoiselle Felicie ! " It is always thus ! " said
he; " it is by that most unholy, most
abominable of all passions, love, that the
demon plots the fall of men. If you had
not been driven to madness by your
unhappy uncle's refusal to allow you to aspfre
to the object of your choice, you would
never "


The dying man stopped him. "Pardon,
mon pere," he whispered, laying his cold
clammy fingers on the priest's arm, "I am
innocent there;—quite innocent; it was
not for Mademoiselle Felicie; I could have
done without her ! but I saw that my uncle
might live a long time, and that I might
die before he did even; that, at best, I
should probably be long past my youth
<!-- Leaf 274, Page: 260 -->
when I got his money; and that seemed
to me so very, very sad, so unjust, that it
became unbearable; and I was tempted, as
I have told you. Indeed, that is the truth,
the entire truth. Not Mademoiselle Felicie !
no, no ! I really coidd have done without
her!" And that was the truth, and the
Abbe le Eoy was glad that it was so.


And so the cause of sin was not love,
but greed. Impatience ! impatience to
enjoy !


One person,—the only one from wiiom
no secret could be kept,—fully confirmed
Eichard Prevost's statement, and that
person was Madame Jean. " Seigneur
Jesus! " said she, when the priest of St.
Philbert talked with her over her deceased
young master. " I should never have
suspected Monsieur Eichard of loving any
<!-- Leaf 275, Page: 261 -->
one. I won't swear that he was capable
of becoming a saint for money, but I would
have sworn that he was incapable of
committing a crime for love ! " Now Madame
Jean herself did, four weeks after Eichard
Prevost's demise, marry the brigadier de
gendarmerie, ancl she gave as a reason
that, "you couldn't tell whom to trust!"
which enigmatical sentence was interpreted
by the evil-minded into meaning that
Madame Jean was afraid, U she did not
marry the gendarme, of being murdered
by him in order that he might steal her
money.


As to Mademoiselle Felicie, her situation
became promptly a satisfactory one,—which
was gratifying, considering what a practical,
right-thinking, meritorious young person
she was, with so well-regulated a mind !
<!-- Leaf 276, Page: 262 -->
\"All in such perfect equilibrium," said the
public. She went, immediately after the
trial, to stay at Tours, with the
worldlyminded relative who had been in the habit
of sending her and her sister Paris
newspapers. There she completely enslaved a
stout, good-looking, middle-aged colonel,
almost as well-born as he was intellectually
common-place, and possessed of fortune
sufficient to render the post of mistress of his
house an agreeable one. With him Felicie
de Verancour contracted a marriage which
was a model for all proper and sensible
marriages between well-born people. No
hint of her so nearly becoming Madame de
Chateaubreville, with the thousands a year of
thc then unsuspected criminal to spend, and
for wiiich, had the position been achieved,
the wiiole department would have courted
<!-- Leaf 277, Page: 263 -->
her;—no hint of this will ever, believe me,
get abroad. Felicie wiU always, as she
does now, go into that society which deems
itself the best, and in it she will continue
to be esteemed and honoured, being at the
same time only just enough pitied, to
prevent her being envied, for her close
connection with that blameable young woman her
sister, whom, to the end of time, Felicie
will with a shudder of mourning vfrtue
style " that unfortunate creature ! "


And what of Vevette ? No opposition of
any kind being offered by the Vicomte, the
necessary formaUties were accomplished, and
Eaoul and Vevette became man and wife,
the ceremony being performed by the Cure
of D, and the Admiral being the chief
witness. The Cure made them no discourse
upon the occasion, he only blessed them from
<!-- Leaf 278, Page: 264 -->
the depths of his very heart, and solemnly
told them to be all in all to each other.


The Admiral immediately offered a home
to Eaoul and his wife, until he could find
some employment for the former. They all
proceeded to Paris, taking with them
Monsieur de Morville the elder, whose
unconscious state saved him from all the
miseries which had fallen on those nearest
to him. The Admiral's means were not
large, but he was respected, and had
influence. He soon obtained for his nephew the
post of vice-consul in one of the Spanish
Eepnblics of South America. It was an
unhealthy place, where no man of any value
would go, but where, if he could contrive
to save life, fortune might be honestly made
by a clever enterprising man. Of course
Eaoul accepted, and so did Vevette, and
<!-- Leaf 279, Page: 265 -->
they wrent forth together hand in hand,
serene and grave, trustful in Providence,
and convinced that total unselfishness alone,
ancl passionate devotion to another, can
sweeten the solemnity of life.


In the world they left behind them, both
were severely judged. After the first
emotion was over, the public unanimously
condemned poor Vevette, and the masculine
part of the community were angrily taken
to task by all their female relatives if they
allowed an expression of interest or
compassion for her to escape them. "What an
example for Julie or Marie, or Catherine or
Louise! " That wras the argument used,
and it never failed of its effect; and the
browbeaten male, whenever it was applied
to bim, hung his head and felt small; and
so poor Vevette came to be regarded
<!-- Leaf 280, Page: 266 -->
everywhere as a black, black sheep, and in one
heart only, in that of the Cure of D,
will she for ever remain a " ewe lamb."


If in ten or fifteen years Monsieur and
Madame de Morville,—as is very possible,
—return from their tropical exile wealthy,
and with the renown of excellent services
attaching to Eaoul's name, they will be
wiiat is termed " well received," and
perform the irksome function which is described
as "going everywhere," but "Society" will
be on its guard against any intimate
adoption of them; and the institution called in
France La Famille will regard them as a
menace, for Pater and Mater-familias will
cordially unite in holding up their hands at
sight of this erring couple, who, not content
with loving, went and married for love.  
  
  
  That is the real crime; the mere love is
<!-- Leaf 281, Page: 267 -->
to be got over. Here and there a broken
heart—voila tout! Not much harm therein;
but to go marrying for love;—oh ! no !


\"AVhat would become of us all," would
cry Society in France, " if the matrimonial
association were once to be established on
the all-for-love principle ! "  
  
  
  THE END.
